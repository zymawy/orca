/**
 * Compatibility owner lookup shared by the existing consumer surfaces.
 *
 * Tranche 0 intentionally preserves this pre-migration precedence byte-for-byte; switching
 * these consumers to canonical evidence belongs to tranche 1.
 *
 * Why this precedence: launch intent is the authoritative bootstrap before any
 * process signal exists, so it leads. Once launch metadata is gone — a mirrored
 * or restored pane drops the host-owned launchAgent — the owner must fall
 * through to a durable pane identity rather than to the raw title, because a
 * wrapper agent's title (OMP emits Pi-compatible frames) cannot be told apart
 * from the agent it wraps. The host-stamped hook identity is that durable,
 * published, mirror-safe anchor; the last completed hook and the hibernated
 * session record carry it across the windows where no live hook exists. Ranking
 * launch/live-hook above the completed/sleeping records keeps a genuine pane on
 * its real agent and stops a stale record from hijacking it.
