/**
 * Which kind of workspace a launch lands in, read from the workspace's own id.
 *
 * The three kinds are not interchangeable to a launch: only a git worktree and a folder workspace
 * have somewhere a structured session can live, and the floating terminal — a sentinel with no
 * backing repo, worktree or folder row — can host a PTY and nothing else.
 *
 * It lives in `shared` because both sides of the launch ask the same question: the renderer when a
 * user opens an agent tab, and the host when it resolves an `agent.launch` target. A host must
 * never take the answer from a caller, so it derives it here from the id it resolved itself.
