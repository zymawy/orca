// ─── THE ORDERING RULE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `(authorityId, incarnation, revision)` is a total order ONLY within one authorityId.
// A different authorityId means "incomparable", not "older" — the id is regenerated per
// authority instance, so a restarted main, a second machine, and a renderer that parsed
// bytes itself all sequence into disjoint spaces. Consumers must fall back to today's
// timestamp rule across authorities, never mix the two orders.
//
// ─── THE DECAY RULE (neither original review caught this) ───────────────────
// Staleness must be computed against the SAME authority clock that stamped `observedAt`,
// or replicas must decay on LOCAL RECEIPT time instead.
//
// `observedAt` is the authority's wall clock. `isExplicitAgentStatusFresh`
// (renderer/src/lib/pane-agent-evidence.ts) computes `rendererNow - <observation clock>`, and
// for a MIRRORED REMOTE entry the authority's stamps are the HOST's clock. A host running
// minutes fast made every remote row look permanently fresh; a host running slow made them
// decay on arrival. Declaring `observedAt` display-only does NOT fix that — the skew is in the
// subtraction, not in the tiebreak. A replica must either receive the authority's own
// freshness verdict, or stamp its own receipt time and decay against that.
//
// RESOLVED by the receipt stamp: `buildMirroredAgentStatusPatch` writes
// `mirroredEvidenceReceivedAt` from the replica's own clock, and
// `agentStatusEvidenceObservedAt` decays against it, so both sides of the subtraction come
// from one machine. The authority's own verdict was rejected: a published verdict is computed
// at publish time and cannot age between snapshots, so the moment the host stops publishing —
// the loss-of-contact case this whole rule exists for — the replica would hold `fresh` forever.
// The receipt stamp keeps decaying while nothing arrives, which is the required behaviour.
