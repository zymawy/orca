// What a structured provider said about its child work, in the child-work vocabulary.
//
// A producer decodes provider frames into these edges and the host folds them into the one
// record per child it owns. Edges carry facts, not records: which child is live, what it is
// doing, how it ended, or that it is gone. Only a child's own ending settles it, or the end of its
// session. Edges are host-internal: the producer and the store share one process.
