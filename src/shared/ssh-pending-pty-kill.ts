 *  on the user's remote machine with nothing left to retry it. Marking the attempt `unverifiable`
 *  is correct but is not a fix; the kill is an intent that has to outlive the transport failure and
 *  be replayed against the authoritative host when contact returns.
 *
 *  Carried on the existing `SshRemotePtyLease` rather than in a second journal: the lease is
