/**
 * Global session fields that belong to the 'local' slice alone: `splitWorkspaceSessionByHost`
 * writes them only there and `mergeWorkspaceSessionsFromHosts` reads them only from there. A copy
 * inside a non-local partition is residue no read can reach — stale `browserUrlHistory` replicas
 * alone were 589 KB, 12.7% of a 4.65 MB store, rewritten on every save and reparsed on every
 * launch.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT every field in `GLOBAL_WORKSPACE_SESSION_FIELDS`. Two separate gates disqualify
 * the rest, and both are load-bearing:
 *  - `activeWorktreeId` and `activeWorkspaceKey` are `'direct'` in
 *    `WORKSPACE_SESSION_WORKTREE_REFERENCE_KIND`, and both `collectPersistedSessionWorktreeOwners`
 *    and the deregistered-repo residue sweep read them out of EVERY partition. Dropping one
 *    un-owns a worktree, and an un-owned worktree gets its metadata pruned.
 *  - `activeTabId`, `activeConnectionIdsAtShutdown` and `activeRepoId` have live main-side readers
 *    on a partition: `isPersistedTerminalLeafActive` falls back to `activeTabId` for the mobile
 *    projection, and the runtime attach-window handoff unions `activeConnectionIdsAtShutdown`.
 *
 * `workspace-session-partitions.test.ts` re-checks both gates for every field listed here.
