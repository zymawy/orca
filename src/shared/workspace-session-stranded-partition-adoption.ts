/**
 * Fold rows a host partition holds alone back into the session the readers assemble.
 *
 * Shipping builds split one SSH workspace's session across two partitions: the renderer wrote
 * `local`, the main-process runtime wrote `ssh:<targetId>` (#12723). `workspaceSessionPartitionHostId`
 * now names a single owner, but both stores still hold real data, so every reader has to reunite
 * them once before the write path returns the result to that owner.
 *
 * **A workspace is adopted whenever the host partition names it at all — not only when it has
 * terminal tabs.** The write path routes EVERY worktree-scoped field to the owning partition, so a
 * workspace with open editor files, browser tabs or tab groups and no terminals lives there just as
 * completely as one with terminals. Gating on tabs would strand exactly those, and unlike terminal
 * state they cannot be recovered from the SSH host snapshot, which carries terminal fields only —
 * an unsaved `dirtyDraftContent` would be destroyed outright.
 *
 * That is why the walk below switches exhaustively over `WORKSPACE_SESSION_FIELD_OWNERSHIP` instead
 * of listing the fields it knows about: a hand-maintained list is what let editor and browser state
 * fall out, and a new ownership kind must not be able to fall out the same way.
 *
 * Adoption is told which session keys the read found **contested**. Every rule below rests on the
 * premise that `local` and `ssh:<targetId>` are one workspace written twice — and a bare
 * `repoId::path` id claimed by more than one host is exactly where that premise is false. The
 * contention split cannot answer it, because ssh slices are deliberately kept out of its claimant
 * set, so the caller reaches the verdict itself — from the repo catalog and from the other
 * partitions it read — and passes it in: a contested key may still be gap-filled, never replaced.
 * Without that, an SSH workspace's rows overwrote a different workspace's rows under the same id,
 * and routing then wrote them into that workspace's own partition.
 *
 * `adoptedWorkspaceIds` reports which workspaces came out of `host` uncontested. The write path
 * routes those back to that partition directly, so a row does not depend on a repo catalog naming
 * the host before it can be returned to where it was read from.
 *
 * The one thing the base keeps unconditionally is a workspace it holds **terminal tabs** for. That
 * is the live copy the user is looking at, and merging a stale partition into it would re-add tabs
 * they had closed on every launch. Leaving it alone keeps this a one-shot repair, at the cost of
 * not recovering rows stranded beside a populated workspace — which are stranded on main today too,
 * so it is never a new loss. An EMPTY tab row is not such a copy: an empty list is not evidence
 * that anything was closed (`mergeDirectSshRemoteWorkspaceSession` argues this at length, and
 * docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md makes it general — "we could not see it" is
 * `unverifiable`, never proof of absence). Treating it as the truth is what published an empty tab
 * list and let `replace-session` delete the host's copy (#12721).
