// Which agent produced a journal row, and the one place absence is interpreted.
//
// One journal is the durable record of one agent SESSION, and a session may run
// subagents. Both agents' rows land in the same timeline, so every "what is this
// agent doing right now" reader has to say which producer it means. Readers ask
// "is this NOT mine", never "is this mine": the session's own agent stamps
// nothing, so root-ness is the absence of an id rather than a value to match.
// That absence is decided by a row's FIRST write: a later revision naming no
// producer keeps the row's existing one (see the journal reducer).
