/**
 * Windows command-line construction.
 *
 * Two parsers read the line Orca hands to CreateProcess, and they disagree:
 *
 * - The target program's own startup code (`CommandLineToArgvW`, which the CRT and
 *   Node both use) understands `\"` as a literal quote and `\\` as a literal
 *   backslash.
 * - `cmd.exe` — unavoidable for a `.cmd`/`.bat` target — does NOT. It counts `"`
 *   naively to track quote state, and inside that state it still expands `%VAR%`.
 *
 * So a `\"` written for the first parser silently flips cmd's quote parity, and
 * every later `&` `|` `<` `>` on the line stops being data and becomes an
 * operator. Measured on Windows 11 with a real `.cmd` shim: `["a b", 'c"d',
 * "e%F%g", "h&i", "j^k"]` came back as `["a b", 'c"d', "e^%F^%g", "h"]` — the
 * `&` truncated the argument AND ran the remainder as a command.
 *
 * The encoding below satisfies both parsers at once and round-trips all of the
 * adversarial cases; see windows-command-line.test.ts for the corpus.
 */

/**
 * Quote one argument for `CommandLineToArgvW`, writing an embedded `"` as `""`
 * rather than `\"`.
 *
 * Why `""` and not `\"`: both spellings decode to a literal quote, but only `""`
 * leaves cmd's naive quote count even. Since the same encoding has to survive a
 * cmd hop for `.cmd` targets, we pay the (identical-length) `""` spelling
 * everywhere rather than keep two dialects.
 *
 * Backslashes are still doubled before a quote and at the end of a quoted run,
 * because that part `CommandLineToArgvW` does interpret.
