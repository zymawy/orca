// A workspace id is `repoId::path` with no host component, so the local host, an
// SSH host and a paired runtime can all publish the SAME id. The same repo at the
// same path on two hosts is TWO workspaces, never one — removing by that id alone
// destroys whichever checkout routing happens to pick, and routing prefers the
// ACTIVE workspace's host, which is usually not the row the user confirmed.
//
// So a destructive removal travels as a host-qualified target and is ROUTED to
// the confirmed host. Making the field required (not optional) is the point: a
// future delete entry point cannot be written unguarded without a type error.

/**
 * Identity for a destructive workspace removal.
 *
 * `executionHostId` is required but nullable on purpose: `null` states that the
 * confirmed row itself declares no host (a pre-host-qualified snapshot row), so
 * a caller has to make that claim deliberately instead of omitting the field.
