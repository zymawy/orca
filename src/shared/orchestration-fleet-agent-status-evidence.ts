// ─── The one identity/clock contract the fleet path reads ────────────────────
// A hook row carries a pane key, a delivery timestamp and, from newer hosts, an
// observation timestamp. A row may carry the runtime handle observed with OSC, but
// fleet authority still resolves terminal identity from the runtime. The matcher needs both,
// and every fact it needs used to be an OPTIONAL
// field on `AgentStatusIpcPayload` — so an unenriched producer published a row the
// matcher silently failed to identify (failure table L-1) and a missing observation
// clock silently degraded to the delivery clock (W1-14 / RR-W-P1A).
//
// Here absence is an arm with a reason, never a missing property. The evidence type
// deliberately exposes no `terminalHandle?`, no `evidenceObservedAt?` and no raw
// payload, so a consumer cannot read an absent identity or clock by accident.
//
// This type never crosses IPC or the wire. `AgentStatusIpcPayload` remains what
// `agentStatus:set` / `agentStatus:getSnapshot` publish.
