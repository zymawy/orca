   * so a second desktop can cold-restore a tab this machine parked, and the rare captures
   * (force-park, hibernate, sleep, shutdown) still write it. This field is **local-only**: the
   * ordinary cold park fires every time a workspace is hidden, and shipping that in a wholesale
   * `replace-session` costs tens of MiB on the common path for a copy no peer consumes.
   * `exportRemoteWorkspaceSession` is an explicit allowlist of named top-level fields, so a
   * top-level field is omitted from the upload for free — a field *inside* the layout would ride
   * along, because layout entries are copied whole. Do not move it into the layout for tidiness.
   *
   * Second property, by construction rather than by a fix: the mirrored-tab apply rewrites only
   * `ptyIdsByTabId` and `terminalLayoutsByTabId`, so a host inventory frame cannot wipe this.

   * Never read either home directly — go through `resolveLeafScrollbackBuffers`, which also
