/** Which relay PTYs a client may prove it orphaned, and therefore may stop (#9819).
 *
 *  A relay PTY is a child of the detached relay daemon. Stopping one destroys a running process —
 *  often a running agent — on the user's remote machine, and the relay's 50-slot cap is a far
 *  cheaper failure than that. So every rule below is written to answer "can this client PROVE
 *  nobody owns this?" and to answer "no" whenever it cannot.
 *
 *  The rule #9819 proposed — "pane-bound and the app no longer owns or leases it" — is not that
 *  proof. Absence from a client-side set is `unverifiable` by construction
 *  (`docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md`): a second machine running the same Orca build
 *  connects to the SAME relay and displaces the session owner, and its PTYs are missing from THIS
 *  client's store for exactly the same reason a genuine orphan is. Sweeping on local absence alone
 *  would let one laptop reap another laptop's live agents.
 *
 *  What replaces it: the host itself records which authenticated consumer identity asked it to
 *  create each PTY, and publishes that back. A PTY is sweepable only when the OWNING HOST names
 *  this client as its creator and this client's own durable state has no route to it. Both halves
 *  are required; either alone is a guess.
