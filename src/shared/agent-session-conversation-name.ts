 *  is covered with no list to remember; U+200C/U+200D are the one exception,

 *  Wales flags degrade — far cheaper than an invisible payload in a label.
 *  Deliberately NOT reached: blank-RENDERING letters and marks such as U+2800,
 *  U+3164 and U+115F, which are Lo/So/Mn rather than any invisible category. A
