// Which result belongs to which call inside one run.
//
// A run's blocks arrive as a flat stream of calls and results, and the renderer
// used to draw both: every call line was followed by a `Result` line of its own.
// That doubles the height of an opened run and puts the least interesting row —
// a result whose preview is usually the first line of stdout — at the same level
// as the command that produced it. Pairing lets the call own its output, so the
// run reads as the work it did.
//
// Pairing is positional, the same FIFO rule `dropUnattributableToolResults`
// already uses to decide a result is attributable at all: a result answers the
// oldest call that has not been answered yet.
