/**
 * One place that answers "which agent is in this pane".
 *
 * Today four ladders answer it independently — the tab icon, the open-tab/search occupant, the
 * sidebar title rows, and the sidebar hook-row fallback — and they disagree. Two of them consult
 * the terminal title before the launch record, so a string Orca parsed outranks a fact Orca owns.
 *
 * Two rules make this resolvable where reordering alone could not:
 *
 * 1. Evidence is ranked by how directly it observes the process, and a display title is last.
 * 2. Every observation carries the `runId` of the agent run it belongs to. Evidence from a run
 *    that has since been replaced is INELIGIBLE rather than merely outranked.
 *
 * Rule 2 is what separates two situations that are otherwise identical. A completed hook naming
 * A plus a title naming B is either a bug (the hook is right, the title is stale) or a legitimate
 * reclaim (the pane was reused and B really is there). Same signals, opposite answers. With run
 * ids they are different facts: in the bug both belong to the current run, and in the reclaim the
 * hook belongs to a previous one.
 *
 * A run is advanced only on positive evidence that a new agent started in the pane — an accepted
 * launch, a recognized command at a shell prompt, a host-confirmed foreground change, a new
 * provider session. Never by a title changing, and never by transport loss.

/**
 * Which agent run a piece of evidence belongs to.
 *
 * Why the authority and not a bare number: `incarnation` is only a total order WITHIN one
 * `authorityId` (see agent-status-observation.ts). The id is regenerated per authority instance,
 * so a restarted main, a second machine, and a renderer that parsed bytes itself each count from
 * their own floor. Comparing bare numbers across them silently equates unrelated runs — a
 * restarted host reporting `incarnation: 1` would match a live run 1 from before the restart.
 *
 * Runs from different authorities are INCOMPARABLE, not different.
