// Why a submission is `rejected`: the message provably did not happen.
//
// The host writes each rejection twice: `reason`, a sentence (or, for the cases older clients
// already recognise, one of the legacy markers below) that released clients print as it is, and
// `rejection`, the typed fact newer clients read — both from `agentSessionFailureWords`.
// `classifyDispatchRejection` is the only place a reader judges either.
//
// Every rejection makes the one claim that state exists to make: this message did not reach the
// provider. None is ever re-delivered under its own id — `rejected` is terminal in the reducer — so
// a retry rotates the client message id, which is a new message and cannot duplicate.
