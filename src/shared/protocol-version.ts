// Bump RUNTIME_PROTOCOL_VERSION when:
//   - You remove an RPC method or required parameter that clients use.
//   - You change the meaning (units, nullability) of an existing field
//     clients read.
//   - You change encrypted framing, terminal stream framing, or auth.
// Do NOT bump for:
//   - Adding new RPC methods.
//   - Adding new optional fields on existing methods.
//   - Adding new ignorable event types.

// refuse older clients. Bump MIN_COMPATIBLE_RUNTIME_SERVER_VERSION when
// this client build requires a newer server. Exact app-version equality is
