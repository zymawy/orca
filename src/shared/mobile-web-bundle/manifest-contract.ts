 * A screen the desktop asks the phone's shell to render from this bundle rather than natively.

 * matches a concrete route against it. `grants` names what that screen needs the shell to do on its
 * behalf; a shell that does not implement one of them renders the native screen instead, which is
 * the capability negotiation that keeps an old app against a new bundle on a working screen rather
 * than a dead tap.
 *
 * `optionalGrants` names what the screen is better with and complete without (ruling 37). Serving
 * the route reads `grants` alone, so the all-or-nothing rule above is untouched and an author who
 * cannot show a screen at all without a capability still keeps it native; only the session's
 * granted list reads both. Which side a capability goes on is the desktop's call, because the
 * desktop is what knows which screens it has proved.
 *
 * Optional rather than defaulted to `[]`: a desktop older than the field writes no key, and a shell
 * whose policy predates the field never reads one, so it serves the route on its required set.
 *
 * What it does NOT get is a reader that strips the key. `pageRouteSchema` on the phone is
 * `z.looseObject`, which passes unknown keys through rather than dropping them (measured on zod
 * 4.4.3), so the entry an older shell holds still carries this field. That is why the publish path
 * must build the pairs it hands the bridge instead of forwarding a manifest entry: the pair schema
 * is `.strict()`, and an entry reaching it refuses the whole session rather than one field. See
 * `page-route-policy.ts`'s `routeViewOf`.
