/**
 * Replay safety for `agent.launch`.
 *
 * A launch creates a workspace, an agent, or both. When its reply is lost, the caller cannot tell
 * "the host never saw it" from "the host ran it and the answer went missing" — and mobile retries a
 * lost create by design (`worktree-create-retry.ts`), so the retry is the ordinary case, not the
 * edge. Retrying without an operation id is how one tap becomes two agents in two workspaces.
 *
 * The fix is the ledger `agentSession.*` already runs on: the caller names the operation once, the
 * host records that name durably before doing anything, and every later arrival of that name gets
 * the recorded answer rather than a second agent. What this module adds is the launch-shaped parts
 * of that contract — the digest over what a launch DOES, and the child id its inner attach reserves
 * under.
 *
 * This is safety, not recovery. Nothing here probes for a surface a previous attempt may have left
 * behind, adopts one, or finishes an interrupted publication; an operation whose outcome is unknown
 * stays unknown and is refused.
