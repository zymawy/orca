// ─── Native chat conversation model (cross-process, IPC-serializable) ────────
// The single renderer-facing conversation contract for the native chat view.
// Assembled from layered sources in priority order: on-disk JSONL transcripts,
// live agent-hook events, and (as a degraded fallback) scrollback scrape — see
// docs/plans/2026-06-17-001-feat-native-chat-view-plan.md (KTD2). Everything
// here must be plain JSON: these values cross the IPC boundary, so no class
// instances, Maps, or Dates.
