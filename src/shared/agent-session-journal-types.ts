// ─── Canonical agent-session journal: cross-process wire shapes ─────────────
// The host-owned timeline for a structured agent session. Everything here must

//
// Rows are append-only. `schemaVersion` is upcast at read time and never
// rewritten in place, so a host that cannot read a row refuses to write the
// journal rather than skipping or compacting past it.
