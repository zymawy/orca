// What the newest turn in a structured journal is doing right now, read off the
// tail of the item list. Every scan here stops at the turn's own record — the
// typed `turn` item, or the legacy status row that carries one — because state
// from an earlier turn is never this turn's state.
//
// These scans answer for the SESSION'S OWN agent. A subagent's rows share this
// journal and are usually the newer ones while a child runs, so each scan skips
// anything a subagent produced; the transcript still renders every agent.
//
// Each scan reads the turn record BEFORE it checks the producer, which is only
// safe because a turn row can never carry linkage: a turn is the SESSION'S unit
// of work, and no producer of a turn-bearing body stamps one. Both lanes were
// checked — Claude's turn rows are built with no linkage at all, Codex writes
// turn rows only for its primary thread (the one thread it never stamps), the
// compact row passes only a fence, and the stale-turn and dead-generation
// sweeps name no producer, so their turn revisions keep the turn row's own
// (none). So a child-linked row can never be what terminates one of these
// scans. Re-check that before giving any of those sites a producer.
