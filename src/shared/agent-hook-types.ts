// to keep a single source of truth for the version string and status contract.

// Why: bumped whenever the managed script's request shape changes. The
// receiver logs a warning when it sees a request from a different version so a
// stale script installed by an older app build is diagnosable instead of
// silently producing partial payloads. Still at v1 because the endpoint-file
// rollout is additive — pre-endpoint-file scripts still post the same JSON
// body shape, and no in-wild v1 script exists that a future v2 receiver would
// need to distinguish from: Claude/Codex/Gemini installs run for everyone on
// first launch but no v1 fleet ever shipped, and Cursor's managed script is
// rewritten on every install() call so there is no durable on-disk v1 script
// to inherit. Reserve the next bump for a real wire change.
