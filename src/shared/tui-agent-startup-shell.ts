 * Why not plain sh quoting: fish's single quotes are not literal. Inside `'…'`
 * it treats `\\` and `\'` as escapes, so the sh `'\''` idiom collapses every
 * backslash (a `\d+` regex, a `\\server\share` UNC path) and a trailing
 * backslash is a hard syntax error that kills the launch outright.
 *
 * Both shell families agree on two things: a single-quoted run is literal apart
 * from those escapes, and `"\\"` is one backslash. So emitting backslashes as
 * `"\\"` and apostrophes as `"'"` between single-quoted runs round-trips in all
 * of them, and Orca never has to know which shell will read the line.
 *
 * Verified against sh, bash, zsh, dash and fish 4.7.1 over regex escapes, UNC
 * and drive paths, trailing/lone backslashes, mixed quotes, `$`/backtick/`$()`
 * expansions, globs, braces, operators, comments, newlines, tabs and non-BMP

/**
 * Clears one or more environment variables, in a form correct in every shell a
 * queued command line can land in.
 *
 * Why it carries its own fish/sh branch rather than a single builtin: `unset`
 * does not exist in fish, and `set -e` in bash enables errexit rather than
 * clearing anything, so neither spelling is safe alone.
 *
 * Why not a helper function defined by Orca's shell wrappers: Orca only wraps
 * zsh, bash and fish. A login shell of `sh`, `dash` or `ksh` launches
 * UNWRAPPED, and this text is also copied to the clipboard and pasted into
 * shells Orca never spawned — in all of those a helper would be `command not
 * found`, which is the exact failure this exists to avoid.
 *
 * Why two statements rather than `A && B || C`: in fish, `set -e` on a variable
 * that is already unset returns non-zero, so an `||` fallback would run the sh
 * branch too and print `Unknown command: unset`. Each branch is guarded by its
 * own test, so exactly one runs and the other is only parsed.
 *
 * The trailing `true` pins the exit status at 0: the guard that does NOT fire
 * leaves a non-zero status behind, and this is the last statement of a launch
 * line, so that status is what the user's prompt would render.
 *
 * `command test` rather than `test`, because an interactive shell expands
 * aliases and `alias test=...` would otherwise skip both branches silently.
 *
 * `set --erase` rather than `set -e`, because `$fish_pid` is a heuristic: any
 * non-empty value takes the fish branch. `set -e NAME` in the sh family enables
 * errexit and replaces the positional parameters, silently changing the
 * semantics of everything after it. `set --erase NAME` is the same erase in
 * fish, but in sh `--` ends option parsing, so a misfire is a usage message on
 * stderr and nothing else.
 *
 * `$fish_pid` is set by fish 3.0+ and by nothing in the sh family, and fish
 * does not export it, so a fish parent cannot make a bash child misread itself.
 *
 * `-g` is not optional: it scopes the erase to fish's GLOBAL scope, which is
 * where an inherited environment variable lands. Without it, a name that exists
 * only as a UNIVERSAL — `set -Ux CODEX_HOME …`, a perfectly normal thing for a
 * fish user to have — is permanently deleted from every future session. That is
 * real data loss to undo one launch's injection, and it is reachable from the
 * clipboard command, which a user may run with no Orca-injected value at all.
 * With `-g`, a universal shadowed by an injected global is revealed again
 * instead, which is the wanted outcome.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT: under `set -u` the sh side aborts on the unset `$fish_pid` and
 * the variable survives. `${fish_pid-}` would be nounset-safe but is a fish
 * parse error, and so is `set +u`.
 *
 * The one spelling that does satisfy both is a fish-builtin probe — e.g.
 * `math 1 >/dev/null 2>&1 && … || …` — because it references no variable at
 * all. Rejected deliberately: it EXECUTES whatever that name resolves to on
 * the user's PATH, twice. `math` is a real binary (Wolfram Mathematica ships
 * `/usr/local/bin/math`); measured with one on PATH, clearing a single variable
 * took 10.4s and then did not clear it, because a probe that exits 0 is an
 * unconditional false positive. Trading a rare uncleared prefill for an
 * arbitrary program execution on the launch path is the wrong direction.
 *
 * Verified to clear the variables, write nothing to stderr and exit 0 — whether
 * they were set or already unset — in sh, bash, zsh, dash, ksh and fish.
