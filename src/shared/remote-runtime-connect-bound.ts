/**
 * Connect-phase bound for the Node-side remote-runtime WebSocket transports.
 *
 * Why: a host that is powered off or firewalled black-holes the TCP SYN, so the
 * socket neither opens nor errors. Without this the only bound is the caller's
 * whole-request timeout (60s in the CLI), which reads to the user as a frozen
 * terminal.
 *
 * `ws` maps `handshakeTimeout` onto the `http.request` `timeout`, which Node
 * implements as a socket *inactivity* timer: armed before DNS/connect and reset
 * by connect completion and by every response chunk. So this is "12s with no
 * bytes at all", not a 12s wall-clock budget — a slow-but-answering host is not
 * cut off, while a silent one fails promptly.
 *
 * The value matches `CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` in
 * `src/renderer/src/web/web-runtime-connection-transport.ts`, which already
 * bounded the browser transport (a wall-clock budget there).
 *
 * Why this is not the duplicate bound that was removed from the relay control
 * socket: there, both timers were 15s and the class one was wall-clock from
 * construction, so the transport timer could never win and covered nothing.
 * Here the whole-request timer is 15s (60s in the CLI) and measures the RPC,
 * not the connect, and this one is inactivity-based and strictly tighter — so
 * it is the bound that actually reports an unanswered host, with the specific
 * message the recovery classifiers need, rather than a generic RPC timeout.

 * the phrase is the only thing keeping the terminal pane retrying instead of
