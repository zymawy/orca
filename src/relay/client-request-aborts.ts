  // keys are scattered through the map, so any correct loop still visits every entry, which made a
  // full churn of N clients cost K*N*(N+1)/2 visits. Only an index makes a teardown proportional to
  // what that client actually owns.
  //
  // Why the inner key is a string: the codec only checks `jsonrpc === '2.0'`, so a request `id` can
  // arrive as `"7"` while `rpc.cancel` coerces its `id` through `Number(...)` and looks up `7`. The
  // flat map's template key folded both onto `"7"`; keying the raw value would file them in
  // different buckets and silently drop the cancel. `String(...)` is the template literal's coercion.
