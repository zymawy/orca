/**
 * The one thing a close tombstone is allowed to do, and everything it is not.
 *
 * The bug it exists for: the `pty.kill` for a closed SSH tab rejects with a transport error, so the
 * close never reaches the host, the host keeps listing the tab, and every reconnect re-inserts it.
 * The bug it must never cause is the opposite one — PR #14361 was reverted for deleting live tabs —
 * so every case below that is not "an id this client watched the user close" keeps the tab.
