/**
 * What a reconnect is allowed to do to local state.
 *
 * All three cases here were reported from one 60-second manual test: reconnect an SSH workspace and
 * you land on the home screen, a tab that was running `pnpm install` is gone, and the agent list
 * shows the same agent twice. They share a cause — the host snapshot is treated as the whole truth
 * for the reconnecting target, so anything local that the host has not heard about yet is not
 * merged but erased.
 *
 * The host is authoritative for what it knows. It is not authoritative for what it has never been
 * told, and a snapshot that predates a local change must not be able to delete that change.
