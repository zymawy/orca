// Why this module exists: recovery's budget used to live in module-level Maps
// keyed by tabId. Anything keyed outside the row needs a release path, and the
// release fired on every remount-driven pane disposal — so each remount erased
// the budget it had just consumed and the cap never held (crash b5cfc6ca).
// The ledger now lives on the row, so "the budget released itself" has no
// expression: reading the budget IS reading the tab.
//
// The control is not the count. A remount that mounts a pane which fails the
// same way is not evidence that anything changed, so recovery gates on an
// OBSERVED outcome, borrowing the direct-SSH pane retry vocabulary
// (DirectSshPaneRetryResult): an attempt that has not settled blocks the next
// one, and a settled failure refuses the same reason until a new trigger.

// Backstop only — a breadcrumb-emitting ceiling for a loop the outcome gate
// somehow failed to catch. The outcome gate is what stops a storm.
