 * host-qualified on purpose (STA-4343), keeping a row per (host, id). Emitting
 * both mounts one workspace's tabs twice under a duplicate React key. Listing
 * surfaces such as the sidebar must keep showing every host.
 *
 * `worktreesById` is the store's first-wins per-id index, and that collapse is
