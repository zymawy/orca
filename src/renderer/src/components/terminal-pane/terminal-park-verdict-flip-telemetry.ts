/**
 * Cold-park verdict telemetry and a safe-side circuit breaker.
 * Field breadcrumbs prove render-cadence flips, but not which eligibility input
 * oscillates; damping keeps the pane mounted rather than let it cycle.
 *
 * Two horizons, because churn harms in two ways: a burst reaches React's commit
 * bail (#185), while churn merely sustained remounts the pane over and over.
 * A remount does not reconnect a terminal — parking deliberately keeps the PTY
 * alive (see terminal-parked-tab-watchers), SSH restores from main's snapshot,
 * and a remote runtime re-subscribes a stream on a per-environment multiplexer
 * that outlives the pane. What it costs is a remount each time, indefinitely.
 * Retention force-parks bypass sustained pins; burst protection still applies.
 *
 * What this is NOT: a fix for whatever keeps re-proposing the park. That input
 * is still unidentified, so this caps the remount rate of an oscillation rather
 * than ending it — the pin masks the rendered verdict, and the driver resumes
 * the moment each pin lapses.
 *
 * Scope: flips are counted on the rendered verdict and the pin subtracts from
 * that same verdict (selectParkVerdictPinnedTabIds), so churn driven by any
 * parked input — worktree-level park, portal ownership, deferred activation
 * mounts — is damped, not only the cold-park candidate set. A repeating `burst`
 * crumb for one tab therefore means the driver keeps re-proposing the park once
 * each pin lapses, not that damping never reached it.
