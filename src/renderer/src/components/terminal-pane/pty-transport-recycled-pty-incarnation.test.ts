/** A restarted SSH relay renumbers PTYs from pty-1, so a fresh spawn is routinely handed an id
 *  whose previous shell is still emitting a late exit. Applying that exit to the new shell reports
 *  it as already dead (`exitedBeforeAttach`), the pane never binds a PTY, and the tab is blank and
 *  unusable forever — the runtime-proven failure behind #16970.
 *
 *  #16970 dated every buffered record and dropped anything older than the spawn request. That fence
 *  is a clock, so it cannot judge a stale exit that arrives AFTER the request left. These specs pin
 *  the identity rule that can: the incarnation names which lifetime of the id died. */
