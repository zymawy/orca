/** Settle a spawn that resolved without a PTY id, remounting the pane when
 *  nothing else owns its recovery.
 *
 *  Why this is not self-correcting: the pane stays mounted with no transport
 *  binding, so `registerData` never runs. Main keeps pushing pty:data for the
 *  old id, the dispatcher finds no handler and buffers it in the pre-handler
 *  buffer — which claims no delivery credit, so the bytes are ACKed anyway and
 *  main's flow control reads healthy while the pane displays its last frame
 *  forever. The visibility reconciler skips unbound panes, so nothing else
 *  rebinds one. A remount reattaches over the still-live PTY and drains the
 *  buffer.
 *
 *  A direct-SSH lease runs its own retry ledger, so it keeps ownership here and
 *  a second remount never races it. */
