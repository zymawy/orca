 * group is not misreported as hidden by filters.
 *
 * Worktree ids are not host-qualified (STA-4343): the same id can name a
 * workspace on two hosts, so an id-only match would let a host-filtered remote
 * target pass on the strength of its visible local twin. When the caller knows
 * the target's host, the visible twin must resolve to that host too.
