/**
 * Turns a host-derived structured turn completion into unread markers and one OS notification.
 *
 * This is the structured lane's counterpart to `dispatchTerminalNotification`, and it deliberately
 * does NOT go through it. That function's first half arbitrates PTY evidence — a committed
 * terminal title against a hook status snapshot, with staleness and pane-reuse rules — because a
 * terminal only ever infers that a turn ended. A structured session does not infer: the execution
 * host derived this completion from its own journal commit and it carries an explicit outcome.
 * Running it through the terminal preamble would mean re-deriving a fact we were handed.
 *
 * What it does share is everything after that: the same neutral policy in
 * `attention/agent-attention-policy`, the same four store sinks, #21274's structured surface
 * adapter, and the same delivery tail — so suppression, acknowledgement, addressing, the success
 * sound and the blocked-permission fallback all have exactly one implementation.
 *
 * EVERY SETTLED TURN NOTIFIES, matching the CLI lane: the outcome picks the wording — "finished",
 * "failed" or "stopped" — exactly as the hook lane's verdict does. A turn with no outcome is UNKNOWN — the host sends no event for one, and nothing
 * here may turn that absence into success. A request that settles while a prompt (a subagent's
 * approval, say) waits on the user is worded "needs input" instead, as the hook lane words a
 * blocked row.
 *
 * Unread and delivery come out of ONE `resolveAgentAttention` decision. "Do not alert me about
 * something I am watching" is already answered by focus, in the surface adapter's viewed gates and
 * in main's `suppressWhenFocused`; there is no second suppression path here.
