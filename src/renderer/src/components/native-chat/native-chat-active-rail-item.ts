// Which rail tick is lit, decided from virtualizer offsets rather than rendered rows.
//
// A DOM scan is the obvious way to answer "what is on screen", and it is the wrong
// one here: the transcript is windowed, so an off-window row has no element to
// measure. Virtual items carry the same answer without that hole.
//
// The row at the fold is usually the agent's, not the reader's — most of a long
// transcript is reply. Resolving it through `turnKey`, which every row carries and
// which holds the id of the user message that opened its turn, is what keeps the
// reader's own prompt lit while they read the answer to it. Asking instead which
// *user* row is on screen goes dark for the whole length of a long reply.
//
// Every offset below is in the scroll container's own pixels (rows are placed at
// `item.start - scrollMargin` inside a sizer sitting `scrollMargin` down), which is
// the same space as `scrollTop`. That keeps the comparison honest under the
// transcript's `zoom`, where a bounding rect would be off by exactly the zoom factor.
