// The desktop chat telling main that this session is on screen.
//
// A structured chat is an in-place view on a terminal tab, so closing the tab unmounts this and
// nothing else in the close path knows a provider process is involved: `closeUnifiedTab` retires
// the PTY and drops the tab, main hears nothing, and a codex app-server outlives the chat for the
// rest of the app's life. Surface activity is the honest signal — it covers closing the tab,
// closing the window, and visibility changes for retained panes, none of which share a code path.
//
// The release CHAINS off the hold rather than racing it: an unmount during the hold's round trip
// would otherwise release a hold that has not landed yet, and the late hold would never be undone.
//
// A current host ignores both: it starts an agent only for a send. They stay for older hosts, until
// MIN_COMPATIBLE_RUNTIME_SERVER_VERSION passes the first host that ignores them.
