 * Mounts the active worktree's activation-deferred tabs, one per idle frame.
 *
 * Why after the reveal and not during it: the switch only owes the user the
 * pane they are looking at. Everything else is warm-up, so it runs where it
 * cannot delay a frame — and the worktree still ends up as fully mounted as it
 * was before deferral, which is what keeps later tab switches instant.
 *
 * One tab per effect run, not a loop: admitting bumps the mount revision, which
 * re-runs this effect and schedules the next one. The drain is the render cycle.
