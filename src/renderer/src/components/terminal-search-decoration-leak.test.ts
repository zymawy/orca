/**
 * Regression for STA-2707: search highlights stayed painted after the find bar
 * closed, until the window was minimized and restored.
 *
 * Mechanism, in @xterm/xterm's SortedList (patched in
 * config/patches/@xterm__xterm@*.patch, generated from the source patch under
 * config/patches/xterm-src/):
 *
 *   - DecorationService keys its SortedList on `decoration.marker.line`.
 *   - `delete()` only records an index and defers the array compaction, while
 *     `Marker.dispose()` sets `line = -1` — mutating that very sort key.
 *   - So after the first disposal the array is no longer sorted, and the binary
 *     search inside `delete()` can miss a decoration that IS present. `delete()`
 *     returns false, `onDecorationRemoved` never fires, and the decoration keeps
 *     reporting itself at its cells forever.
 *
 * `clearDecorations()` disposes the active (top-layer) match first and the
 * match highlights after, which is exactly the order that trips this — so
 * closing search left one match highlighted. Repaints don't help: the leaked
 * decoration is still live, so every repaint faithfully re-paints it.
 *
 * These tests drive the REAL Terminal + SearchAddon and assert through
 * `forEachDecorationAtCell` — the same lookup both renderers use to decide a
 * cell's background — so a regression fails here regardless of renderer.
