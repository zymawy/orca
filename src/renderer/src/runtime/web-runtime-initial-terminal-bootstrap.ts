/**
 * Which runtime-owned workspaces already have an initial-terminal bootstrap in flight.
 *
 * The bootstrap used to be latched by a `let` inside the session-tabs subscription closure, which
 * made "one focus creates at most one terminal" true only for as long as that one closure lived.
 * Its effect re-runs whenever the environment, connection generation, pairing revision, or
 * session-ready flag settles — all of which move during a workspace switch — so a second closure
 * re-armed the flag while the first create was still in flight and seeded a second terminal
 * (STA-6173). This latch outlives the closures.
 *
 * It is keyed by environment AND worktree, not worktree alone: a worktree id is `repoId::path` with
 * no host component, so the same id can be live on two paired runtimes at once (STA-4343). Keying
 * per environment lets a per-environment teardown release only its own in-flight keys — clearing
 * every environment's latch would release a sibling environment's pending create and let a new
 * subscription for it seed a duplicate, which is this very bug through another door.
 *
 * `creating` blocks every other closure while the create RPC is in flight. `awaiting-mirror` is a
 * create that resolved without the mirror yet holding a row for the worktree: the host may have the
 * tab and the frame simply has not landed, so the latch stays held — releasing here is what let the
 * next empty frame seed a duplicate. The next frame the mirror accepts for that worktree is its
 * answer either way (a row now exists and the predicate declines on its own, or the host genuinely
 * has no terminal and a retry is right), so that frame releases it. Without that release a create
 * whose frame never lands would suppress every later auto-seed until environment teardown.
