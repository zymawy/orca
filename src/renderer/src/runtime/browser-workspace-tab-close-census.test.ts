// Why: who tears a browser workspace down is a policy, and every close site that decides it alone
// gets it wrong in a different way — the ambiguous multi-owner close fell through silently, the
// pageless host mirror was un-closable, and the menu's Close Tab fired at a host that had never
// heard of a staged tab. Testing planBrowserWorkspaceTabClose in isolation cannot catch the next
// site that skips it, so this census pins every renderer file that closes a browser workspace:
// how often it reaches for the store action, and whether it asks the shared plan first. Adding a
// close anywhere fails this test until it is classified here.
