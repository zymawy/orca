/**
 * "Same publisher" had two answers that disagreed. `noteRetiredValue` treated a `:headless-merge:`
 * epoch as a successor of its base and retired the base when it became current, while
 * `sameSessionTabsPublicationLineage` treated the two as one publisher. The retired-value check
 * matched exactly, which is what kept those two from ever meeting: a suffixed frame was simply a
 * different string, so it never looked retired.
 *
 * The cost was that the same predecessor was accepted or rejected depending on which shape it
 * arrived in. These pin the single answer: a lineage sibling is the same publisher everywhere — it
 * advances the current epoch instead of superseding it, and it inherits its generation's
 * retirement instead of escaping it.
