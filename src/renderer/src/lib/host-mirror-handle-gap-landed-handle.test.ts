/**
 * The fourth eviction trigger: a PUBLISHED HANDLE ends the gap episode its verdict measured.
 *
 * Why none of the other three reach it. The generation rule cannot: the #19647 change in this same
 * stack stops recording `status: null` for an unreachable host, so `connectionChanged` no longer
 * fires across an outage on one runtime. The tab-death rule cannot: the row stays published the
 * whole time — it is the HANDLE that comes and goes, which is the definition of the gap. Teardown
 * cannot: the environment is still here. And the read-time pane-identity check cannot, because the
 * pane that reattaches to the SAME PTY is deliberately the same pane
 * (`host-mirror-handle-gap-verdict-union.test.ts`, "answers for a genuine reattach").
 *
 * So a verdict outlives the gap it was about, and the NEXT gap on that pane gets no wait at all —
 * #19735 with the bounded wait removed rather than merely shortened.
 *
 * Why this does not reopen the park/expire/replay loop the verdict exists to break: that loop is
 * a handle that NEVER lands. A landed handle between two gaps is positive host evidence, and each
 * wait is still individually bounded by the deadline.
