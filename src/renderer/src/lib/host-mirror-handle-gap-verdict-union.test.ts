/**
 * The UNION suite for `expiredGenerationByPane`.
 *
 * Three agents changed this one map on three branches and each verified only their own. These
 * cases exist because nothing else proves the rules compose: individually-correct rules whose
 * interaction nobody tested is the exact failure this was looking for.
 *
 * Four orphan classes, and what covers each:
 *   A  tab churn on a LIVE environment        tab-death rule, recording environment only
 *   B  REMOVED environment                    clearHostMirrorHandleGapVerdictsForEnvironment
 *   C  cross-environment QUIESCENCE           generation rule, per key, every environment
 *   D  REUSED tab id                          read-time pane identity, NOT a prune
 *
 * D is the one that needed no new trigger: every trigger the other three own fires downstream of
 * the moment it needs. The verdict instead carries the PTY binding its pane held AT PARK TIME and
 * only answers for a pane that still holds it.
 *
 * Plus the properties no rule may break: the verdict stays sticky enough to break the
 * park/expire/replay loop, a genuine reattach still inherits, and no rule evicts a verdict a live
 * pane still needs.
