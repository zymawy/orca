// The retention suite that the reconciled verdict loop replaced carried one assertion the split
// suites did not: the store subscription is held for exactly as long as something needs it.
//
// Measured rather than assumed, because half of it turned out to be covered already:
//   - RETAIN direction (drop the verdict term from `stopStoreSubscriptionIfIdle`, so a verdict
//     with no waiter behind it loses the subscription its drain needs): already caught, by
//     host-mirror-handle-gap-landed-handle.test.ts. Two failures there without this file.
//   - RELEASE direction (never release the subscription at all): caught by NOTHING else. With
//     `stopStoreSubscriptionIfIdle` neutered, the three cases below are the only failures in the
//     handle-gap and session-tabs tree: 326 tests across the other 37 files still pass. A leaked
//     subscription rescans every parked pane on every store write for the life of the session and
//     nothing else notices.
//
// So this file exists for the release direction; the retain cases are here because the two belong
// in one place, not because they were missing. `stopStoreSubscriptionIfIdle` counts VERDICTS as
// well as waiters -- the landed-handle drain observes a transition no waiter is parked for -- and
// that is exactly the term the reconcile moved, so both directions are worth holding still.
//
// Asserted through a spy rather than a new test-only export: whether the module is subscribed is
// already observable at the store boundary, and the production surface should not grow to say so.
