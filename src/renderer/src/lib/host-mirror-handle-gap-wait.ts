/**
 * Per-pane park for the frame between a host's tab rows and its PTY handles.
 *
 * Why: mirror hydration says "the rows arrived", not "this pane's liveness is
 * decidable" — the handle lands one relay round trip later. A pane whose leaf
 * is still bound to a PTY of the same environment, with no published handle,
 * is `unverifiable` (docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md); resuming on it
 * forked a session the host was still running (#19735).
 *
 * The wait is bounded because mirror settlement has already happened and will
 * not replay a parked sweep again. Three exits, each replaying the sweep:
 *  - the pane's own handle lands (`ptyIdsByTabId[tabId]` non-empty);
 *  - the row is retracted (the host has spoken: the pane is gone);
 *  - the deadline expires. A handle that has not landed within the RPC budget
 *    is not coming on this connection, so the pane is released to ordinary
 *    recovery: a resume after a bounded wait is defensible, an indefinite hold
 *    is the latch-that-never-releases defect. A reconnect bumps the connection
 *    generation and arms a fresh wait. A deadline that fires while contact is
 *    lost, or after contact was lost and regained mid-budget, releases WITHOUT a
 *    verdict: it measured the outage, not the host, and the re-park arms a
 *    fresh wait the same way.
 *
 * Sustained reconnect churn can therefore hold a pane parked indefinitely: each reconnect voids the
 * in-flight verdict and grants a fresh full budget. That is CORRECT, not the defect above. Under
 * churn the pane's liveness genuinely is unverifiable, and `docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md`
 * forbids resolving unverifiable to `exited`. It has the shape of a latch that never releases, so
 * do not "fix" it by letting a verdict from one connection decide another — that is #19735.

 * Connection generation whose wait already expired for the pane.
 *
 * FOUR drains, with four different triggers. Getting the scopes right is the whole design; see
 * `recordExpiredWait` for why the first two must NOT share a scope.
 *  - superseded generation: per key, EVERY environment. Runs on any recording, anywhere.
 *  - dead tab row: the recording environment ONLY. Runs on a recording in that environment.
 *  - removed environment: `clearHostMirrorHandleGapVerdictsForEnvironment`, on teardown. The only
 *    trigger that fires at all for an environment that will never record again. A row stranded
 *    there is inert — removal advances the generation, so it can never match — so that one is a
 *    leak fix, not a correctness fix.
 *  - PUBLISHED HANDLE: `retireVerdictsWithLandedHandles`, from the store subscription. The gap a
 *    verdict measured is over once its pane publishes a handle, so the NEXT gap must get its own
 *    wait. The other three provably cannot reach this: the generation no longer moves across an
 *    outage on one runtime (#19647, same stack), the row stays published the whole time — it is
 *    the HANDLE that comes and goes — the environment is still here, and the read-time pane
 *    identity below deliberately lets the same PTY inherit. It is the only drain that needs the
 *    subscription to outlive the waiters, which is why `stopStoreSubscriptionIfIdle` counts
 *    verdicts too.
 *
 * A FIFTH class is covered but NOT by any of those drains: a retracted tab id republished as a
 * different pane, which would inherit the old pane's verdict and skip its own wait — the #19735
 * direction rather than a longer hold. No trigger can reach it, and the reason is worth keeping:
 * the dead-row predicate stops matching once the id is live again, teardown is the wrong event,
 * and a pane holding a verdict never parks, so no waiter is there to observe the retraction. It is
 * closed at READ time instead, by `hasHostMirrorHandleWaitExpired` comparing the verdict's
 * park-time `paneBinding` — a pane that binds a newly minted PTY does not answer to a verdict
 * about its predecessor. Pinned as class D in host-mirror-handle-gap-verdict-union.test.ts; do not
 * delete that case.
 *
 * BOUNDED RETENTION BACKSTOP: a verdict whose row the host retracts for good on an environment
 * that stays paired and never records again. The generation has not moved, teardown never fires,
 * the retracted row can never publish a handle, and the tab-death rule only runs from inside a
 * later recording. While retained, `stopStoreSubscriptionIfIdle` keeps the subscription alive and
 * causes a no-op rescan on writes to the two `HandleGapStoreState` slices above. The 512-entry cap
 * eventually evicts it under cross-pane churn; the entry still costs work while retained, not
 * correctness. It cannot answer: the STORED binding is non-empty, so the `''` early return below
 * does not catch it; what does is the compare against a fresh `paneBindingFor`, which reads '' for
 * a row that is gone.
 * The obvious drain — drop a verdict whose binding no longer matches — is NOT safe: it would break
 * the genuine reattach, where
 * the binding goes away and comes back and the verdict must still answer
 * (host-mirror-handle-gap-verdict-union.test.ts, "answers for a genuine reattach").
 *
 * The PUBLISHED HANDLE drain does not close that class and must not be read as closing it: it
 * needs the row to stay published throughout, and that class needs the row to go away. Read-time
 * identity separates two panes behind one tab id; the drain separates two gaps on one pane. They
 * look adjacent and are orthogonal — mutation kills them with disjoint tests.
 *
 * Why this comment block is worth re-reading against the code rather than trusting: the paragraph
 * above it spent one commit asserting this class was still open and demanding a trigger that had
 * just been replaced by the read-time check, while the test it named as its pin said the opposite.
 * Several agents change this map in parallel and the invariants move faster than the prose, so
 * when the two disagree the test file is the one that ran.
