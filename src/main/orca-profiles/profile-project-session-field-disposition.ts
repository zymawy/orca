 * Why this exists: `clientHostedBrowserPagesByWorktree` was added to the session type and then
 * missed by three separate prune paths, because nothing made handling it mandatory. Classification
 * is now a compile error to skip, and the two owner-keyed lists below are what those paths
 * actually iterate -- so a field marked `prunedByOwnerKey` is pruned by construction.
 *
 * Not covered: `mergeWorkspaceSessions`, the apply side of a transfer, is still a hand-written
 * field list. It is safe for this field only because `extractSessionForTransfer` never emits it --
 * classify a new field as transferable and that merge has to be edited by hand.
