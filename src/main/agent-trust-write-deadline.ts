/**
 * Why: callers hold launch admission on a trust write, but the write is not
 * self-bounding. The local Codex writer queues on the per-`config.toml` lane
 * shared with hook installs and app-server trust grants (up to 10s native /
 * 30s WSL each, with no cap on how many are already queued), and the SSH
 * writer chains a `session.resolveHome` round trip plus unbounded SFTP
 * read/write calls over a link that may be half-open. Without a cap the user
 * clicks "start agent" and nothing happens, with no error.
 *
 * 20s covers a native grant session holding the lane with headroom. Past that
 * we stop waiting and let the launch proceed *untrusted*: the write is never
 * cancelled and still lands, and the agent meanwhile raises its own "Do you
 * trust this folder?" prompt. Giving up therefore fails closed — it can only
 * lose the ordering optimisation, never grant trust that was not written.
