/**
 * A shell that exits by itself must still close its pseudoconsole.
 *
 * `ClosePseudoConsole` is the only thing that reaps a ConPTY's console host —
 * Orca's own job-ownership patch says so, because `CreatePseudoConsole` spawns
 * that host before the per-pty job exists and it is therefore not a job member.
 * Upstream node-pty calls it from exactly one place, `PtyKill`, which begins by
 * looking the baton up by id — and the exit watcher in `SetupExitCallback`
 * erased the baton the moment the shell died. So on the self-exit path (typing
 * `exit`, which is how panes usually close) that lookup missed, `PtyKill` did
 * nothing at all, and the pseudoconsole was never closed.
 *
 * There is a SECOND, independent defect on the same path: the `useConptyDll`
 * branch of `WindowsPtyAgent.kill()` disposed the conout worker only from an
 * `_outSocket.on('data')` handler, and no more data arrives once the shell has
 * gone — so that worker leaked too. The non-DLL branch beside it already
 * disposed unconditionally. The desktop always sets `useConptyDll`, so it hit
 * both; the relay sets neither and hit only the first.
 *
 * Measured on Windows 11 / awin, 20 cycles, handles bucketed by NT object type,
 * totals before -> after:
 *
 *   self-exit,     relay spawn     225 -> 285   becomes  219 -> 219  FLAT
 *   self-exit,     desktop spawn   239 -> 439   becomes  222 -> 222  FLAT
 *   explicit kill, relay spawn     225 -> 285   becomes  219 -> 219  FLAT
 *   explicit kill, desktop spawn   235 -> 395   becomes  219 -> 219  FLAT
 *
 * Neither fix alone is enough on the desktop: the pseudoconsole close is worth
 * +1 Process +1 File per terminal, the dispose +2 Thread +4 File.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A PATCH-CONTENT PIN AND NOT A BEHAVIOURAL TEST: the defect is
 * only observable as a per-NT-type handle count, which needs
 * `NtQuerySystemInformation(SystemExtendedHandleInformation)`. Nothing in the
 * repo can read that, and the cheaper Windows-observable proxies do not
 * discriminate — the console host process is reaped either way (the leak is a
 * handle to an already-exited object, not an orphaned process), and the
 * `\\.\pipe\conpty-*` entries disappear either way. Both were measured and
 * rejected as assertions rather than assumed. So this pins the mechanism
 * instead, which is the real risk: a future resync of the vendored patch
 * silently dropping the hunk.
