 *   state; counting those is what makes every reconnect inflate the totals.
 * - Only a LIVE event may open a session. A replayed or disk-restored `working`
 *   describes work that began in some earlier runtime, so crediting it would
 *   mint a phantom spawn (see #14610: replays carrying an unchanged state used
 *   to re-arm live timing, and cached replays re-fire completion side effects).
 *   A restored row's `mainAgent` is as historical as its `state`; neither opens.
 * - Any event may CLOSE a session this recorder opened. A replayed `done` is how
 *   a client learns about a completion it missed while disconnected; refusing it
 *   would strand the session open until the quit flush.
