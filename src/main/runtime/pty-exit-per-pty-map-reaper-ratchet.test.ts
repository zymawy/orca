/**
 * Ratchet: `onPtyExit` is the reaper for per-PTY runtime state, and every
 * per-PTY-keyed collection on the runtime must be accounted for there.
 *
 * `ptyLifecycleGenerationById` was added next to ~25 siblings the reaper already
 * deleted — including `agentPromptExplicitStatusFloorByPtyId`, set two lines below
 * it in `advancePtyLifecycleGeneration` — and was simply never added to the list.
 * Nothing failed, so it accumulated one number per PTY for the life of the process.
 * A hand-maintained delete list has no way to notice the next omission; this does.
 *
 * The field list is read off a real instance rather than parsed out of the source,
 * so a map declared in any of the ~90 mixin files is covered the moment it exists.
 * Every field must land in exactly one bucket, and the two "cleaned elsewhere"
 * buckets are verified against real source rather than trusted as an allowlist.
