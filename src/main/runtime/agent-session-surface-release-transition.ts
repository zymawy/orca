// Releasing the lease when the LAST surface lets go of a session.
//
// Every other release in the wire needs a probe, because every other release is about a process
// somebody else started and nobody watched die. This one is different: the host stopped its own
// lease-owning provider root through the adapter. Its observed exit is sufficient because the
// lease follows that root, even when descendants remain `unverifiable`.
//
// The fence still moves, so the next owner is a new generation: an attach or settlement still
// holding the stopped owner's fence is refused as stale rather than acting on its successor.
