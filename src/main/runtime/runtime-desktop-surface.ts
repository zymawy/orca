/**
 * The desktop facilities `OrcaRuntimeService` uses, which a Node host does not have.
 *
 * Three sites, all optional by nature: a native notification toast, a lookup of the
 * authoritative renderer window, and one ipcMain channel used only by the
 * renderer-backed tab-create fallback. With no renderer that fallback is unreachable —
 * `createTerminal` already takes the background spawn branch when there is no
 * authoritative window (#10333) — so a Node host needs none of them.
 *
 * Defaults are inert rather than throwing, for the same reason as the PTY bindings: a
 * host with no desktop legitimately has nothing here, and that is not a downgrade.
 * Where absence IS user-visible — a notification that would have been shown — the
 * runtime already routes to paired clients, which is the better destination anyway.
