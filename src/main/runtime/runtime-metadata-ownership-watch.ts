/**
 * Why: `orca-runtime.json` is the CLI's only pointer at a live runtime, and it
 * can stop describing this process while this process is still serving RPC —
 * a second instance that slipped past the single-instance lock publishes its
 * own pid and then exits, leaving the CLI on a dead pid (`stale_bootstrap`)
 * against a healthy app (#7848). Chromium's lock is defeated on macOS whenever
 * `SingletonSocket`/`SingletonCookie` go missing, and its socket lives under
 * `$TMPDIR` (`/var/folders/.../T`), which macOS itself purges after 3 days.
 *
 * The owner therefore watches its own record and reclaims it once no live
 * runtime is described. Reclaiming only a dead pid is deliberate: two live
 * runtimes sharing a profile would otherwise ping-pong the file forever.
