/**
 * `terminal read` for a worker that IS a structured agent session.
 *
 * Peers peek at each other's recent output constantly, and for a PTY worker that is `terminal
 * read`. A structured worker had no answer at all: `worker-read` demands a dispatch id and
 * coordinator standing a peer does not have, so the only agent-to-agent read verb refused to
 * resolve the handle. This serves the same verb from the session's journal.
 *
 * The result is a plain `RuntimeTerminalRead` — the journal is projected to LINES and bounded by
 * the very reader the PTY tail uses — so nothing an agent reads reveals which kind of worker
 * answered. `limit` and `truncated` keep their existing meanings.
 *
 * `cursor` does NOT, and is refused rather than approximated. The PTY contract is an index into an
 * append-only completed-line buffer with a monotone count. A session journal is a REDUCED, MUTABLE
 * timeline: an item's projected text changes at its original sequence after later items exist, the
 * delta coalescer revises items repeatedly, settlement can rewrite one smaller, a pending approval
 * renders as nothing and then as something, and `sequence` resets on epoch rollover — so no index,
 * numeric or opaque, stays valid. `worker-read --source transcript` is a window index over the same
 * bounded page, not an append-only anchor; do not point callers at it as one.
 *
 * The refusal is therefore permanent, not a stopgap, and no windowed alternative should be built:
 * a broken cursor fails UNSAFE (a silent hole in a poller's output) while diffing a bounded tail
 * fails safe (a harmless re-read), and a second paging-shaped verb would invite the PTY assumptions
 * this one cannot honour.
 *
 * READ ONLY, deliberately. `terminal.show` still refuses a structured handle: synthesising a
 * `ptyId`/`leafId`/`paneRuntimeId` would hand every public terminal verb something that looks
 * writable and is not.
