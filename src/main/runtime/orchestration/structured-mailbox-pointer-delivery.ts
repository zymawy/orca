/**
 * The pointer-delivery lane for workers that ARE a structured agent session.
 *
 * The PTY lane types the nudge into a live pane and reads the idle edge off the terminal title.
 * Neither exists here, so this is a sibling of `OrchestrationMailboxPointerDelivery` rather than a
 * branch inside it: batch selection is literally shared (`selectOrchestrationPointerBatch`), and
 * everything below it is different — the nudge is a session turn, the idle edge is the journal,
 * and only an `accepted` dispatch may consume mail.
 *
 * Coordinators are in scope here, unlike the PTY lane's reasoning: a PTY coordinator blocks in
 * `check --wait`, where a waiter preempts pointer delivery, but a structured coordinator is a chat
 * session whose turn ends — so nothing else would ever wake it for its own `run:` mail.
