// Resolution is done at send-time: one message record per recipient, same thread_id,
// so each recipient gets their own read-tracking (Section 4.5). The caller picks the
// candidates: the sender's Run for every group but `@worktree:<id>`, which names one
// workspace explicitly. There is no host-wide candidate set.

/**
 * Whether this terminal IS the addressed agent.
 *
 * Why the host's resolved identity and not the title: a terminal title is a decoration channel
 * that routinely contains other agents' names, because people describe agent work in their task
 * titles. Matching `@claude` against the title delivered the message to any pane whose task text
 * happened to say "claude" — a Codex pane reviewing a Claude PR received Claude's instructions.
 * Recorded titles like "Switch Claude and Codex off the load balancer… - grok" are the ordinary
 * case, not a contrived one.
 *
 * Why an absent identity means NO: `agentIdentity` is absent when the host predates the field or
 * had no evidence beyond the title. Delivery is an action, so unknown fails closed. Not
 * delivering is visible and recoverable — the sender sees no recipients; delivering to the wrong
 * agent is neither.
