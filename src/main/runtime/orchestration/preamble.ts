  // or refreshing the retry.

  cliCommand?: OrchestrationCliCommand
  // Why: populated by the coordinator's dispatch pre-flight (§3.1) only
  // when the target worktree is behind its tracking remote. When absent
  // or when `behind === 0`, the preamble emits no drift section. Callers
  // must NOT pre-populate this with empty data; the drift section is a
  // loud-but-rare signal tied to the `allow-stale-base: true` override
  // path, and polluting it for fresh worktrees would train workers to
  // ignore it.

// check (threshold 10 min) catches a hung worker within one tick, and

// not as a separate prose block — LLM readers anchor on examples and skim
// trailing prose, so rules must land at the point of use.

  # Report the task outcome (required, exactly once).

  # --body must be a 3-sentence executive summary (what you did,
  # what you found, what's left). Never send an empty body; the coordinator
  # reads the body first and only opens artifacts if it needs more detail.
  # Append --files-modified only when files changed, and append --report-path
  # only when you produced a durable report. Always pass real values; do not
  # send the example placeholders literally.
  #
  # Send worker_done exactly once. Use --outcome succeeded when the
  # requested work is done, or replace it with --outcome failed when it is not.
  # Never encode failure only in prose and never silently exit.
  # Include BOTH taskId and dispatchId in the payload so a late completion
  # from a failed retry cannot complete the current dispatch.
  ${cli} orchestration send --from ${params.workerHandle}${capabilityFlag} --type worker_done --subject "<short status>" --body "<3-sentence summary: what you did, what you found, what's left>" --task-id ${params.taskId} --dispatch-id ${params.dispatchId} --outcome succeeded

  # Send a heartbeat every ${HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MIN} minutes
  # while actively working on the task. The coordinator uses this to
  # distinguish "still thinking" from "hung / crashed." Skip heartbeats only
  # while blocked inside \`check --wait\` or \`ask\` — those calls are
  # themselves liveness signals.
  #
  # Include BOTH taskId and dispatchId in the payload: the coordinator
  # attributes the heartbeat to the specific dispatch context, not just
  # the task, so a straggler heartbeat from a previously-failed dispatch
  # cannot mask a hung retry.
  ${cli} orchestration send --from ${params.workerHandle}${capabilityFlag} --type heartbeat --subject "alive" --task-id ${params.taskId} --dispatch-id ${params.dispatchId} --phase "<short: investigating|implementing|reviewing|waiting>"

  # Ask the coordinator a question and block until it answers.
  #
  # Use this instead of AskUserQuestion: that opens a local prompt the
  # coordinator cannot see or answer, so the task would stall until someone
  # happened to look at this terminal. Send every question through \`ask\`.
  #
  # The \`ask\` verb durably records a question in this Dispatch's Run and
  # blocks until the coordinator replies, then prints the reply body. If the
  # call times out or disconnects, resume with the returned message ID instead
  # of creating a duplicate question.
  ${cli} orchestration ask --from ${params.workerHandle}${capabilityFlag} --question "<your question>" --options "<optional,comma,separated>" --timeout-ms 600000

  # Escalate a blocker or failure (pre-completion, when you need the
  # coordinator to do something before you can continue):

  # start a new file and after a test run — and once more immediately before
  # you send worker_done, so a redirect lands before the task settles.

worker_done ends your turn for this task. Your dispatched work is complete:
stop, return to an idle prompt, and take no further actions — do NOT start
new or unrelated work, do NOT run a sleep/poll loop, and do NOT keep calling
\`${cli} orchestration check\`. The coordinator has already recorded your
completion and expects no further output.

A direct instruction from the user takes precedence over this idle rule.
Treat it as new user-owned work: follow it without coordinator approval or a
fresh Dispatch, and do not send lifecycle messages using the settled task or
Dispatch IDs. Never refuse a direct user request because you were a worker.

Do not exit the shell. Your terminal stays available, and if the
coordinator has more for you it will re-engage this terminal with a fresh
preamble + TASK block, which arrives as new input. Treat that as supervised
work under the new Dispatch; ignore stale follow-ups from the settled task.`

// HTML by the Chat UI, and a rule directly under a paragraph is a setext H2 (giant last sentence).

You may dispatch sub-workers for this task. Bind your own Run first, then create

  ${cli} orchestration task-create --spec "<sub-task>" --json
  ${cli} orchestration worker-start --task <task_id> --worktree current --agent <agent> --json
\`\`\`

You own those sub-workers: wait for their worker_done, and do not report your own
until they have settled. Nesting is capped, so a sub-worker of yours may not be
able to dispatch further.
