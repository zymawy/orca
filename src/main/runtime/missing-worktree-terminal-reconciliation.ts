// carrying O(N^2) rows, which is minutes of stalled teardown on a remote host.
//
// Safe only because this sweep is best-effort. Do NOT reuse this wrapper on a
// `requirePhysicalStop` path: that re-lists *after* shutdown to prove a PTY
// exited, and a pre-shutdown snapshot would make the proof read stale rows.
