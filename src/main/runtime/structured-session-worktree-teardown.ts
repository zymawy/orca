/**
 * The structured half of worktree teardown.
 *
 * `killAllProcessesForWorktree` sweeps three PTY surfaces — the renderer graph, the provider's
 * session list, and the local pty-registry — and a structured agent session appears on NONE of
 * them. It has no PTY, no leaf, and no provider session row. So every sweep counted zero, no error
 * was raised, and removal deleted the checkout out from under a running provider child: the child
 * kept running with its `cwd` gone, the durable record and chat tab survived to republish at the
 * next launch pointing at a deleted worktree, and `worker-show` still reported the worker live.
 *
 * Membership is `location.workspaceId` PLUS the host fence below, and every structured session
 * carries both — so this covers a plain chat session in the worktree as well as a dispatched
 * worker. Liveness is `observeStructuredWorker`, the same `live` / `unverifiable` / `exited`
 * vocabulary the rest of the structured surface uses.
 *
 * `live` here is lease state — a provider child is attached — not work in flight, so it says
 * nothing about whether the user would lose anything. It selects what to CLOSE, never what to
 * refuse over: a removal refuses only on a close that did not settle, exactly as the PTY sweep
 * refuses only on a stop it could not verify.
