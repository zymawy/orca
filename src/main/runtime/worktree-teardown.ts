 *
 * Why all three:
 *  - runtime.leaves is authoritative when the renderer is attached, but is
 *    empty in the headless-CLI case (see design §2b).
 *  - The installed provider's listProcesses() surfaces daemon sessions by
 *    the `${worktreeId}@@` session-id contract (§3.1). Because daemon-init
 *    installs the daemon adapter AS the localProvider via
 *    setLocalPtyProvider(), a single call reaches the right backend in both
 *    daemon-on and daemon-off configurations. LocalPtyProvider uses numeric
 *    ids, so the prefix filter is a safe no-op when the daemon is absent.
 *  - pty-registry covers the fallback local provider case and is the
 *    canonical source for memory attribution; it also redundantly backstops
 *    daemon spawns.
 *
 * Sweeps are best-effort by default. Destructive removal callers set
 * `requirePhysicalStop` so a timeout or unproven stop blocks filesystem work.
 * `allowUnverifiedStop` waives that proof so the gate can never wedge a
 * workspace permanently (#11960) — it must come only from an explicit Force
 * Delete or `--force`, never from the `force` an ordinary confirmed delete
 * already sets to skip the dirty-file prompt.
