/**
 * The orchestration identity — and the CLI reachability — a structured session's own child needs to
 * speak for itself. Both providers' native launches (Claude, Codex) build their child env here.
 *
 * Every structured session carries `ORCA_AGENT_SESSION_ID`, the id Orca minted for it — never the
 * provider's, which rotates on `/clear`. The CLI sends it as the caller, so a bare
 * `orca orchestration check` acts as this session instead of guessing a terminal: with no pane of
 * its own, every guess landed on a sibling, and a destructive `check` consumed that sibling's mail.
 * Identity by session id assumes one machine and one user; crossing a host boundary (SSH, a paired
 * peer) re-opens that decision, and the host refuses a session claim from across one.
 *
 * A dispatched structured worker also keeps the `structworker_` handle it was minted, for the
 * handle-based surfaces outside orchestration; for orchestration the id wins and the host maps it
 * back to that handle, so the worker keeps one identity.
 *
 * The PATH prepend below makes bare `orca` this app's CLI, the SAME function `buildPtyHostEnv`
 * applies, rather than a second, drifting copy of the rule. Orca's Linux CLI installs as `orca-ide`
 * so it never claims GNOME Orca's /usr/bin/orca (stablyai/orca#7904), and on packaged macOS/Windows
 * the bundled launcher is reachable only from the app's own resources dir.
 *
 * `ORCA_CLI_COMMAND` names that same launcher by absolute path, because a provider can run each
 * command in a login shell (Codex runs `zsh -lc`) whose profile rebuilds PATH and puts a global
 * install ahead of this app's. A bare `orca` that reaches another install still acts as this
 * session: any current CLI sends the injected id and dials the instance `ORCA_USER_DATA_PATH` pins
 * below, and a CLI that predates the id refuses on the marker. When no launcher resolves the key
 * is omitted rather than naming a bare `orca`: on Linux that is GNOME's screen reader, and an
 * inherited value names another app.
 *
 * `ORCA_USER_DATA_PATH` pins this instance beside the identity, so any current CLI — the session's
 * own or a global one — dials the Orca that minted the id instead of the production default.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `ORCA_PANE_KEY`. Claude structured sessions run hooks, and a pane key in their
 * environment starts flowing into hook-emitted agent-status payloads and the hook-attestation,
 * agent-row and mobile-projection pipelines, every one of which assumes a pane key names a live
 * PTY leaf. It would also open `selectExactWorkerProviderSession`, which is fail-closed today
 * precisely because a structured session emits no hook agent status.
 *
 * `ORCA_STRUCTURED_SESSION` stays beside the id for a CLI that predates it — one reached through a
 * global install when a shell rc resets PATH — which would otherwise guess a sibling's terminal;
 * such a CLI refuses on the marker. A current CLI checks the id first, so the marker never makes a
 * session with an id identity-less.
 *
 * The handle is read from the registry at spawn time, so an in-host recovery respawn re-bakes the
 * SAME handle rather than a stale or fresh one.
