/**
 * Per-worktree lock guarding terminal spawn against terminal sleep.
 *
 * Why shared/exclusive and not a FIFO mutex: the invariant is spawn-vs-sleep
 * exclusion, never spawn-vs-spawn. A plain queue made every tab of a
 * multi-tab worktree wait for its predecessors' whole spawn, so activating a
 * 4-tab worktree paid a 0/125/212/291ms staircase of pure queueing before the
 * daemon attach even started. Spawns now share the lock; sleep still excludes.
 *
 * Writer-preferring: once a sleep is waiting, later spawns queue behind it, so
 * a steady stream of spawns can never starve a sleep into its 12s deadline.
 */
