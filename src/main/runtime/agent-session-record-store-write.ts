/**
 * Committing the durable agent-session store.
 *
 * Split from the read/parse half so neither outgrows its budget. The ordering below is the whole
 * reason this is its own file: the live path is never absent. New content is made durable in a temp
 * file first, a validated primary is COPIED to the backup, and only then does the rename publish it.
 * Backup recovery keeps the known-good backup in place while publishing the repaired primary.
 *
 * The old ordering renamed the live file aside before writing the new one, so a death in that
 * window left the profile with a backup and no primary — which is exactly the state that wedged a
 * real profile. Copy, don't move.
