/**
 * Pins Antigravity readiness to captured transcripts instead of hand-written fixtures.
 *
 * Five detector attempts were tuned against a five-line screen someone typed from memory, and
 * three of them shipped worse behaviour than the bug they replaced. Nothing here asserts what
 * Antigravity prints: the transcripts do. Six are recorded from a live `agy`; the rest name
 * themselves as skipped until someone can reach them.
 *
 * One case is pinned as a KNOWN DEFECT: the shipped detector refuses a ready screen whose retained
 * tail ends on the error block. That asserts what it does, not what it should.
 *
 * Capture protocol: docs/reference/agent-pty-transcript-capture.md
 * What each transcript decides: docs/reference/antigravity-readiness-evidence.md
