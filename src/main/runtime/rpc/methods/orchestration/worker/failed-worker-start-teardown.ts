 * Undoes what a start created before it failed.
 *
 * A start that never reached ready leaves no settlement to release its binding later, and its
 * session was already published as a chat tab — without the discard, a failed start strands a dead
 * chat tab that the durable restore index republishes on every app launch. Both halves are
 * best-effort by construction, so neither can replace the real error.
 *
 * A created PTY terminal is deliberately NOT torn down: its custody row was written at creation, so
 * `worker-release` on the failed Dispatch owns that cleanup and the coordinator decides when.
