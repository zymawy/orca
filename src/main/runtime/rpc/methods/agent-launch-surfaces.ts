/**
 * How `agent.launch` builds the surface the executor decided on.
 *
 * Both halves are deliberately the plain, user-facing forms: a structured session created for the
 * worktree exactly as `agentSession.create` creates one, and a terminal agent created exactly as a
 * new agent tab is. Orchestration's own factories are NOT reusable here — a worker's session
 * carries a redrive subscription, a mailbox and a background tab that a launch the user asked for
 * must not take — which is why the executor injects this rather than branching.
 *
 * Delivering the launch text is here for the same reason: it is the wire-shaped half. Each surface
 * takes it differently — a structured session commits it to a transcript, a terminal agent takes it
 * on its launch command or as a paste into its PTY — and which of those applies is the executor's
 * decision, carried in as `startupPrompt` or asked for through `deliverTerminalPrompt`.

 *
 * An unrecognized `launch_source` drops the telemetry and starts the agent anyway. The wire keeps
