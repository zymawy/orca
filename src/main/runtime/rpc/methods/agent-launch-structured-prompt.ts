/**
 * Host-side delivery of a launch's initial text to the structured session the launch just created.
 *
 * It exists so a caller does not have to implement delivery itself. Before this, `agent.launch`
 * created the surface and reported the text as undelivered, which was only workable while the one
 * surface that could send — the desktop renderer's chat — was also the one issuing the launch.
 * Mobile and anything else calling `agent.launch` got an agent and no prompt.
 *
 * Nothing here queues. The durable record that the text is owed already exists and is the journal's
 * own submission row: `performSend` appends it before dispatching and the attach path settles it, so
 * a second host-side copy could only disagree with it. What IS reused is the outbox's entry and
 * envelope builders, so this send is shaped exactly like the renderer's and mobile's — same body,
 * same operation id as client message id, same payload fingerprint.
 *
 * The renderer still delivers its own launch prompts, because its launcher does not call
 * `agent.launch` yet; when it does, its launch-sourced outbox entries become this call.
