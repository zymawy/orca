/**
 * Starting and retiring a worker that IS a structured agent session.
 *
 * Three things make this different from the PTY worker path, and all three live here:
 *
 * - The session is created directly as structured, so readiness is the attach returning ok. There
 *   is no boot-to-idle gap to wait on and no `tui-idle` edge to read.
 * - Nothing here keeps its agent running. The idle sweep leaves it running while its dispatch is
 *   open, reading that from the orchestration database; once the dispatch settles the agent rests
 *   like any chat's, and the next mail starts it.
 * - The dispatch preamble is a turn, not keystrokes.
