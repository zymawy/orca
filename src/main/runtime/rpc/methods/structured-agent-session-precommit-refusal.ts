// Nothing before `attach` commits a session, so every failure in that span definitively created
// nothing. Thrown, it reaches a remote client as a generic transport error, indistinguishable from
// an answer that was lost on the way back — and a client that cannot tell those apart either
// strands the user with no chat and no terminal, or spawns a sibling beside a session that may
// already exist. So the whole span answers with a refusal envelope carrying a code, whatever it
// failed on.
//
// Converting the span rather than each throw site is deliberate: alongside the throws that carry a
// code there is a code-less class — an unresolvable worktree, a store that will not open, a host
// that will not install — that no per-site list catches, and it is exactly the class that reaches
// the user as nothing at all.
