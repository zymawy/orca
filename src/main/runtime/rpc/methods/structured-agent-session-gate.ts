// path constructs the host. `agentSession.*` stays refused either way, which is what this gate is for.

/**
 * WHICH GATE DOES A NEW `agentSession.*` METHOD GET?
 *
 * The host setting is admission control, and admission can be revoked while sessions are still
 * open. So the surface splits by what a method does to work in flight, not by how dangerous it
 * sounds:
 *
 *   - Starts, extends, retains or reads work -> `requireStructuredHost`. Revoked admission means
 *     no new turns, no new holds, no new reads. create, send, ensure, setOption,
 *     subscribe, hold, reveal, history, options and the status stream all live here.
 *   - Stops or retires work the caller already owns -> `requireStructuredCleanupHost`. close,
 *     cancel, unsubscribe and release live here.
 *
 * Cleanup keeps working after the setting is turned off because the alternative strands the user:
 * a session opened while the setting was on stays open, and refusing its close leaves a chat with
 * a live provider child that its own owner can no longer shut down. Stopping is never the thing
 * the policy exists to prevent.
 *
 * Cleanup is not an escape hatch. It still demands the negotiated wire capability, so a client
 * that never advertised the surface still cannot see it, and it never creates a host — it can
 * only retire what already exists.
