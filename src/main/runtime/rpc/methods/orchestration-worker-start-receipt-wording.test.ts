/**
 * The exact sentences `orchestration.workerStart` puts in its mode receipt.
 *
 * These were never pinned: the existing suites assert `toContain` fragments ('terminal agent',
 * 'cannot create'), and the CLI suite asserts a receipt handed to it by a mock rather than one
 * this code produced. Every one of them stayed green against a deliberately corrupted vocabulary,
 * so nothing was actually holding the wording. A dispatch receipt is the only place a
 * structured→terminal downgrade explains itself, so the whole sentence is the contract, not a
 * fragment of it.
 *
 * Orchestration's module is now a thin adapter over the shared `agent-launch/agent-launch-mode`,
 * so these sentences also pin the adapter's vocabulary: the shared default wording differs for the
 * remote-host and reused-terminal downgrades, and only `WORKER_START_VOCABULARY` restores it.
