 * the old oldest-item-only fingerprint could not see the normal case. A `running` tool item gains
 * its `[tool result]` at its original sequence once later items exist, the delta coalescer revises a
 * message in place, settlement can rewrite an item smaller, and a pending approval projects to null
 * until it resolves and then appears in the MIDDLE of the array. Under a stable oldest item that
 * fingerprint stayed valid through all of it: a caller could be handed `hel`, resume past it and
 * never receive the revision to `hello world` (omission), or have a resolved approval insert ahead
 * of its saved index and re-read what it already had (duplication) — both returning ok.
 *
 * Scoped to the prefix rather than the whole page ON PURPOSE. Fingerprinting every item would flip
 * the identity every 60ms with the coalescer window during an active turn, making the cursor
 * unusable exactly while the worker is working — a useless verb in place of a silent bug. Tail
 * growth the caller has not read yet cannot invalidate; a change to what it already holds does.
 * Position-dependence is safe because `p` rides in the same opaque payload as the identity.
 *
 * The oldest item stays in the anchor as the window-slide detector: a slide shifts every index.
