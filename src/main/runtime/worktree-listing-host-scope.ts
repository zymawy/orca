/**
 * Applies a worktree listing's row cap and reports which hosts the resulting page covers.
 *
 * Rows are resolved repo by repo, so every SSH repo's rows land contiguously at the end of the
 * fleet order: 24 remote worktrees sat at indices 496-520 of 521 and a 200-row cap returned zero
 * of them (#18104). Balancing the page across hosts fixes the starvation; the scope is what makes
 * the remaining gap legible, because a host with no rows in the page is otherwise indistinguishable
 * from a host with no worktrees — which `docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md` forbids a
 * listing from implying.

/**
 * Which hosts a listing claims to have been looking at.
 *
 * A `--repo` listing was scoped by the caller, so naming every configured host would report gaps
 * the caller deliberately excluded. Naming NONE — which is what a scoped listing did before — means
 * the scope can never report a gap at all, for any host kind, because `covered` and `omitted` are
 * both derived from the returned rows plus this list. A scoped listing whose scan did not succeed
 * then answers `{hostIds: [], omittedHostIds: []}`: byte-identical to a repo that genuinely has no
 * worktrees, which is the one thing docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md forbids a listing from
 * implying.
 *
 * Measured before the fix, on one runtime with one refusing SSH host, in the same second: the
 * unscoped listing reported `omittedHostIds: ["local", "ssh:<target>"]` while the scoped listing
 * reported `[]`.
 *
 * Naming the single host the caller asked about costs nothing when rows come back — it lands in
 * `covered`, so it is never reported omitted — and is the whole answer when they do not.
