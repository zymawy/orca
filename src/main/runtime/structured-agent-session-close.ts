/**
 * Puts the chat tab back after a close that did not settle.

 * The hide is the one visible side effect this function performs before the destructive step, so a
 * failed close that kept it left the user's chat tab gone from the durable restore index — the
 * conversation survived under `userData`, but nothing brought the tab back at the next launch.
 *
 * Re-observed first rather than restored outright: a close can throw PAST its own proof and still
 * have taken the child with it, and `closeStructuredSessionsForWorktree` reads exactly that,
 * counting such a session closed and retiring its tab. Republishing there would resurrect a tab for
 * a session that is demonstrably gone, at the next launch, pointing at a deleted workspace.
 *
 * That observation NARROWS the window; it does not close it. This one and the sweep's are taken a
 * store write apart, so a child that dies in between is unverifiable here and exited there — which
 * is why the sweep re-drops the tab reference when it takes that proof. Do not delete either half
 * on the strength of the other.
 *
 * Never throws: the caller's `reason` is what the user is asked to act on, and a rollback failure
 * must not replace it. `agent_session_identity_required` is the expected one — the record can be
 * gone by now, which is itself the exit this restore is declining to undo.
