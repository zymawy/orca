/**
 * Processes still running under a pane, or null when there is no answer.
 *
 * Read from the pane's Win32 job object. `GetConsoleProcessList` would need
 * console attachment, which is why node-pty answers it by forking a helper, and
 * why asking on a foreground poll exhausted memory (#10857).
 * `QueryInformationJobObject` has no such constraint: one syscall, no children.
 *
 * The job is a SUPERSET of the console -- it keeps console-detached descendants
 * -- so `size > 1` is not proof of life, only absence of proof of absence.
 * `size === 1` (the shell alone) is decisive, and so is membership of a KNOWN
 * pid: the list is complete when non-null and a job is inescapable once joined,
 * so an anchored identity can be confirmed or retired exactly
 * (judgeCachedAgentJobEvidence). Callers must bound only the unanchored rest.
 *
 * Null means unverifiable per docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md, never
 * that processes died.
