/**
 * What becomes of a launch's initial text, and what the receipt is allowed to say about it.
 *
 * Split from the executor because they answer different questions. The executor decides WHICH
 * surface exists and in what order; everything here decides how the text reaches whichever surface
 * that turned out to be, and each surface takes it differently:
 *
 *   structured session  ->  committed to the transcript, named by a message id  ->  journaled
 *   terminal, argv CLI  ->  folded into the command that execs the agent        ->  handed-to-terminal
 *   terminal, no argv   ->  bracketed paste into the live PTY                   ->  handed-to-terminal
 *   anything unproven   ->                                                      ->  not-delivered
 *
 * The argv/PTY fork is not a preference. `argv` exists so multi-line and special-character text
 * reaches a CLI as one argument instead of keystrokes, and it has no readiness race because the
 * text is in the process's arguments at exec time. So it is preferred wherever the agent's CLI
 * takes a prompt argument, and `agentPromptRidesLaunchCommand` — derived from the same injection
 * table `buildAgentStartupPlan` branches on — is the one place that question is asked.
