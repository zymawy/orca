 *  its `readdir` had no deadline, so one stalled listing wedged this create and every later
 *  generated-name create for the namespace until Orca restarted.
 *
 *  The deadline abandons a listing, it cannot cancel one — an unabortable `readdir` keeps its libuv
 *  threadpool thread until the OS releases it, and that pool defaults to four. So a retry is only
 *  allowed once the previous listing has actually settled. Without that, each lapsed backoff stacks
 *  another stuck thread on the same wedged mount until the process loses filesystem access. Keeping
 *  the rule per namespace rather than process-wide is deliberate: a global budget lets one bad mount
 *  spend it on its own retries and starve every healthy repo. */
