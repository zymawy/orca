/**
 * Names `skills update` can still move, judged against what it believes it installed.
 *
 * The updater decides what to do by comparing its lock's `skillFolderHash` against
 * the source tree; it never reads disk. So once the lock records a revision the
 * filesystem does not actually have, the command reports "up to date", exits 0 and
 * writes nothing — no retry converges it. Offering an update there promises work the
 * command cannot do, which is exactly what `eligibleSkillUpdateNames` exists to avoid.
 *
 * The honest signal is the lock's hash versus the `gitTreeSha` of the revision the
 * DISK hashes to. Deliberately not versus the bundled manifest: the updater pulls from
 * the source repo, which legitimately runs ahead of what this build ships, and gating
 * on the bundle would withhold real updates. When lock and disk agree, an update is
 * still genuinely available and stays on offer.
 *
 * Unknown either way (no lock entry, or disk content matching no known revision) is
 * left eligible — silence is not evidence the command is stuck.
