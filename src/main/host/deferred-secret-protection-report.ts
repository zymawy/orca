/**
 * Run the at-rest secret protection report once the app is up, never before.
 *
 * Why deferred: `describeProtectionGap()` asks Electron `safeStorage` whether the OS
 * keyring is usable, and on Linux that is a blocking D-Bus round trip to
 * `org.freedesktop.secrets`. A keyring that is present but locked with no unlock
 * prompter never answers, so the call sits until D-Bus times it out — measured at 76s
 * to first window on Ubuntu 24.04, against 1s on the build before the report existed
 * (STA-5765). Run before the first window, that reads to the user as "the app will not
 * open"; the window is gated behind a diagnostic whose result nothing on the startup
 * path consumes.
 *
 * Why every platform and not just Linux: deferring costs nothing here — no caller reads the
 * result, so the only thing that moves is when a console line appears. macOS pays the same
 * shape against the Keychain, and a probe that has to answer before a window exists is wrong
 * on any host. A deferral that withholds a real secret has to be scoped to the platform that
 * needs it; this one withholds nothing.
