/**
 * Registration for the two hosts that have no scanner-service child of their own.
 *
 * The desktop puts the index in that child because the child is where the
 * transcript reader runs, so one read serves both the session list and the index.
 * Neither of these hosts has that child: orcad ships only the watcher and daemon
 * entries beside `orcad.js`, and the relay's AI Vault sidecar runs the remote
 * scanner, which reads through a filesystem provider and publishes nothing to the
 * transcript channel. On both, the process that would drive the index's reads is
 * this one, and it is the only writer, so the two-process rebuild race the
 * desktop rule avoids cannot arise here.
 *
 * Returns null on a runtime with no `node:sqlite`: both hosts are built for a
 * Node 18 floor, and a host that cannot hold an index registers nothing rather
 * than answering `disabled` for a reason that is not consent.
