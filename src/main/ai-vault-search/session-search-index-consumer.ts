/**
 * The search index as a consumer of the transcript reader.
 *
 * It keeps its own cursor in the `files` table and never consults the parse
 * cache: the two answer different questions and diverge the moment either
 * declines a read.
 *
 * Every refusal leaves the cursor where it was and writes what the next pass
 * needs on the row itself, because the row is the only thing that outlives this
 * read. A declined append is `due`: the index is behind on a span no append
 * reaches, so the file has to be read whole. A read that started and did not
 * commit is `failed`, counted, and stamped with the stat it failed at, which is
 * what stops an unreadable transcript being retried on every pass for ever.
