 * Owns freshness for the index store: a whole-machine sweep, then a timer that

 *
 * A library, not a service. It knows nothing about Electron, the app lifecycle,
 * settings storage, IPC or the panel, and nothing here reads a setting or
 * registers itself anywhere. Whoever constructs it decides all of that.
 *
 * **The store is the only memory.** Every question a pass asks between passes —
 * what is owed a read, what has failed and how often, what the index holds and
 * therefore what may have been deleted, what to report — is answered by a row
 * in the `files` table. There is no queue, no watch set, no hold-out map and no
 * counter with a reset rule.
 *
 * What is left here, and why none of it can be a row:
 * - `roots`, the latest full-sweep snapshot reused by recent cycles.
 * - `previousRootsWithFiles`, the one bit per root the retirement walk's grace
 *   needs. Deliberately not durable: see the mountpoint trade in
 *   `session-search-deleted-sources.ts`.
 * - `cyclesSinceSweep` and `sweepNext`, which are about the timer rather than
 *   about any file, and mean nothing to a second process.
 * - `degradedRoots`, `lastReconcileAt`, `lastSweepCompletedAt` and `left`: what
 *   the last pass observed, held so `status()` can answer between passes.
 *   `left` cannot be a row: a candidate the deadline never reached has no row
 *   yet, which is exactly why no query can see the backlog.
 * - `lastCounts`, the one cached query result, read only after `close()` so that
 *   describing what happened does not reopen a handle the owner has finished
 *   with. While the indexer is open every call re-queries.
 *
 * **Immutable after construction.** There is no `pause`, `resume`, `clear` or
 * `setHistoryDays`. A configuration change is `close()` and a new instance;
 * throwing the index away is
 * `close(); removeSessionSearchDatabase(databasePath);` and a new instance.
 * Widening retention is a new instance whose opening sweep admits the older
 * files; narrowing is the purge that opens every full sweep.
 *
 * The guarantee it makes: while started, a transcript among the newest N per
 * agent that grows, is replaced or is deleted is reflected in the index within
 * one reconcile interval. Everything else is reached by the periodic sweep.
