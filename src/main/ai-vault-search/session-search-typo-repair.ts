/**
 * Spelling repair over the index's own vocabulary.
 *
 * The vocabulary proposes and a scoped count disposes. `messages_vocab` is a
 * view over the whole FTS b-tree: it has no column filter, because fts5vocab is
 * per table, and it counts rows whose session a purge already cut loose. So
 * every decision that reaches the plan — whether a term is already spelled
 * right, whether a candidate is eligible, and which of two equally close
 * candidates wins — is taken from a `messages_fts MATCH` under the same column
 * filter retrieval uses, joined to `sessions`.
 *
 * That is not tidiness. Reading the vocabulary directly made the repair depend
 * on rows the search could never return: tool output suppressed a
 * conversation-scope repair and supplied suggestions the scope would never
 * show, and retention's orphan drain silently changed which word a query was
 * repaired to.
 *
 * The cost is one bounded count per candidate examined, at most
 * `MAX_VISIBILITY_PROBES` per prefix, and only for a term the scope has no
 * posting for. See docs/reference/agent-session-search-query-tuning.md.
