/**
 * Which containers a pass enumerated in full, and every id each of them held.
 *
 * This is the synthetic equivalent of a directory listing, and it has to meet
 * the same bar before the retirement walk may prove anything from it:
 *
 * - **Exhaustive.** Only a sweep enumerates without a per-agent limit. A cycle
 *   asks for the newest N, so an id it did not return may simply be the N+1th.
 *   Callers that are not a census do not build this at all.
 * - **Successful.** A container a scan issue names could not be read, and a
 *   read that failed returns no ids rather than an error the walk can see. A
 *   named container is left out, so its rows stay unverifiable.
 * - **Non-empty.** A container that returned nothing is not evidence that it
 *   holds nothing: a database whose schema this scanner no longer recognises
 *   returns an empty list with no error at all, and believing it would retire
 *   every session in one pass. The cost is one stale row per container whose
 *   last entry the user deletes, until the container gains an entry or goes.
