 *
 * The two halves are separate on purpose. Cutting a session loose from its file
 * is one small transaction, and it is what makes the session stop answering
 * searches — every read joins `sessions`, so a row whose session is gone is
 * already unreachable. Reclaiming those rows is the expensive half, and it can
 * be paused, interrupted or resumed at any point without a reader ever seeing a
 * session that is half deleted. A crash in the middle leaves rows nothing
 * points at, and `drainOrphanedMessages` finds them on the next pass.
