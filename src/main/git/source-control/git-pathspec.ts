 * Why a byte budget and not a path count: 100 was chosen against a raw argv, but

 * ordinary paths reached ~43,000 characters -- past the 32,767 CreateProcess cap
 * -- and the bulk stage failed with nothing staged. Cost is measured per
 * pathspec through the real resolver so the wrapper's quoting rules live in one
 * place.
 *
 * Chunks split only between whole pathspecs, and a pathspec that alone exceeds
 * the budget still ships alone rather than being dropped or truncated. If an
 * invocation fails partway through, the earlier chunks stay applied: every
 * operation here is idempotent and per-path, so `git status` shows the true
 * state and re-running converges.
