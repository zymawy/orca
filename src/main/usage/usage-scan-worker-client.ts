// Why (#20940): this module owns the request half of the shared usage scan
// worker — FIFO one-at-a-time dispatch, a no-progress deadline, respawn-on-fault
// — while WorkerThreadRequestQueue owns the queue mechanics and
// LazyWorkerThreadHost owns the thread's lifetime. The default spawn and the
// process-wide singleton live in usage-scan-worker-spawn.ts.

// Why no-progress rather than wall clock: a cold scan of a real history is
// legitimately minutes — 637 s measured on a 30 GB corpus with 300 worktrees
// before #21130, ~51 s after — and a slower disk or a larger corpus goes past
// any fixed budget. A wall-clock deadline killed those scans, recorded a scan
// error, and left the cache unadvanced, so the next refresh started cold and
// died at the same point, forever. The worker posts a file counter as it goes
// (`UsageScanWorkerProgress`), so this window only has to cover the gap between
// two files; it stays generous because a single huge rollout is still one gap.
