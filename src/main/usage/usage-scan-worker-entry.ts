// Why (#20940): the Claude/Codex/OpenCode/Muse usage scans parse whole history
// corpora and read SQLite synchronously. Running them on this worker thread
// keeps that work off the Electron main-process event loop. The client
// dispatches one request at a time, so this loop stays serial; imports must
// remain electron-free (see the worker-protocol note) — the build's
// plain-node-entry-guard enforces it for this entry.
//
// Child processes: this bundle can fork one. OpenCode discovery's `wslGated*`
// calls fork the WSL transcript sidecar whenever the path is a `\\wsl$\...`
// UNC one, which a `OPENCODE_DB` or `XDG_DATA_HOME` override can be. Measured
// through this entry: the sidecar is reaped by `worker.terminate()`, because
// tearing the thread down closes the IPC channel it owned and the sidecar
// entry exits on `disconnect`. That is the only reason it is not an orphan —
// `terminate()` itself reaps nothing. A future spawn from here that does not
// exit when its channel closes would outlive the app's use of it, so give any
// such child an owner that kills it explicitly. Codex needs no gate (pure
// `areWorktreePathsEqual`). Note the sidecar is re-forked per worker
// lifecycle rather than pooled for the app's life, as it was pre-worker.

// because the corpus is large has to say so. Rate-limited because a 21k-file
// corpus would otherwise wake the main thread 21k times for a counter it only
// reads as "still moving".
