 * (ms since launch) so behavior is testable without timers.
 *
 * The window is rolling, not anchored to launch. A driver can start failing at
 * any point in a session — GPU work is demand-driven, so the first heavy
 * compositing often happens minutes in. Session 12e6ee64 hit exactly `threshold`
 * crashes inside `windowMs` (3 in 26.0s) and was ignored solely because the
 * burst began 920s after launch. What distinguishes a broken driver from normal
 * Chromium churn is that the crashes *cluster*, not when the cluster starts.
