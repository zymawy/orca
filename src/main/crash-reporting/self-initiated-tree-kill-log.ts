/**
 * Records the force-kills Orca itself issues, so a later `render-process-gone`
 * can say whether we were holding the knife.
 *
 * Why: on Windows a `taskkill /T /F` we issue and an external one produce the
 * identical `reason=killed exitCode=1` plus the identical concurrent sibling
 * deaths — reproduced side by side on Windows 11 / Electron 43.4.1, differing in
 * zero recorded fields. This is the field that separates them.
 *
 * Coverage — read this before drawing a conclusion from a zero count.
 *
 * The ring is per-process and its only reader is `process-gone-recorder`, which
 * exists in Electron main. So a count reported on a `render-process-gone` covers
 * kills issued *from Electron main*, and nothing else:
 * - Main only: the families that import the gate directly —
 *   `terminateWindowsProcessTree`, the codex and claude account-login
 *   teardowns, the git command-runner abort, the automation-precheck
 *   timeout — plus the codex app-server POSIX group
 *   teardowns.
 * - Main *and* other hosts, through the `process-tree-kill-gate` seam main
 *   installs the same guard into: `signalProcessTree` (the `runProcess` choke
 *   point, reached from the CLI, relay and daemon too), the codex app-server
 *   deadline kill (compiled into the CLI as well) and the ephemeral-VM recipe
 *   kill. Also host-spanning but recording directly: the POSIX PTY
 *   process-group sweep and the Windows PTY Job Object (relay `pty-handler`,
 *   daemon `subprocess-handle`). When any of these run outside main they record
 *   into that process's own ring, which nothing reads — no gate is installed
 *   there, and the tracer sink is a no-op.
 * - Never instrumented, and none of them a pid-addressed kill issued from main:
 *   the POSIX `process.kill(-pid, …)` group arms of the precheck,
 *   browser-route and ephemeral-VM kills, plus the macOS keyboard-input-source
 *   probe's group kill in `ipc/app.ts`; the relay's own
 *   `subprocess-tree-termination` taskkill and the CLI's login-interruption
 *   taskkill (neither runs in main); and the browser-route Electron probes,
 *   which are reached only from `*.electron.test.ts`.
 *
 * `main-process-tree-kill-gate.test.ts` is the ratchet that keeps that list
 * closed: it counts `/pid` call sites against gate admissions per file, so a new
 * pid-addressed kill fails it whether it lands in a new file or inside a family
 * that already asks the gate. It does not see a `/pid` argument built from a
 * variable.
 *
 * A daemon or relay kill missing from the count is a diagnostics gap, not a
 * missed suspect: those hosts cannot reach a Chromium pid in the first place
 * (see `orca-chromium-process-pids.ts`), and a group or Job-Object kill can
 * only contain what Orca put in it. Absence is evidence, not proof.
