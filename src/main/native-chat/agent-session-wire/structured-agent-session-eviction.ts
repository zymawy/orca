// Stopping one structured session's provider child and handing its lease back.
//
// Teardown is a DATA list, not a method body, for the reason this file exists at all: the host
// tracked which sessions were live in a map, and tore them down at three unrelated call sites
// (app quit, handoff to a TUI, and error cleanup). Closing a chat was never wired to any of them,
// so a provider child outlived the chat that owned it for the whole app session.
//
// ORDER. The provider child stops FIRST. Closing it is not silent: the codex adapter emits its
// `ended` event and flushes coalesced text as part of shutting down, and those are the rows that
// clear the running-turn marker. Draining or closing the sink ahead of that drops them, which
// leaves the durable journal claiming the agent is still working — a worse outcome than the leak
// this teardown exists to fix. So: stop the child, drain what it emitted on its way out, then let
// the sink go. The one step ahead of the stop only reads, for quit's resume offer.
//
// FAILURE. A step that fails ABORTS the rest. `closeSession` returning false means the child's
// exit was not proven and the adapter has deliberately kept the session indexed so a retry can
// reach it; forgetting it anyway stranded the process forever and reported success. Leaving the
// session in place is what makes the next close a real retry instead of a no-op.
