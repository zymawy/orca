 * Releases sends the provider can no longer be holding.
 *
 * A dispatch whose RPC timed out is recorded `unknown` — doubt, never proof of
 * non-delivery — and a live `unknown` reads as work still owed, so the session
 * shows working until something re-derives it. The provider reporting its thread
 * not running, with no turn open, IS that re-derivation.
 *
 * `pending` is deliberately untouched: that send's dispatch has not returned yet
 * and may be in flight right now. And `recovered` only retires the obligation —
 * it never makes a send re-deliverable, because the provider may well have run it.
