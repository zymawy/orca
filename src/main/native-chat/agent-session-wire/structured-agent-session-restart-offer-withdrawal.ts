// When a restart offer ends without being acted on: the chat moved on.
//
// One derived fact decides it, for the offer list and for the continuation's own acceptance alike:
// since the offer was taken, another message was accepted in the chat, or its agent proved a start.
// A message is read against the journal position the offer recorded, so the answer survives any
// number of handle closes. A start is known only to the host that saw it, so it is also written
// to the recovery file when it happens. A restored row, a replayed row or a view carries neither,
// so opening a chat withdraws nothing. The rest of a resume action does not count: its own
// continuation, and the start that continuation waits on.
