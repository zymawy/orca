// When a record may be handed back a provider child.
//
// This used to be inline in the restart restore, which is what made it a STARTUP rule: every record
// whose lease looked like this got a child, at launch, whether or not anything was going to look at
// it. `released` + no handoff is the normal end state of a chat the user closed cleanly, so a
// healthy profile respawned everything it had ever opened. The predicate itself was never wrong —
// it answers "may this be resumed", not "should it be" — so it lives here now and the caller that
// knows a surface is asking is the only one that acts on it.
