// What a host that VANISHES without a clean quit has to release, for the tests that model one.
//
// Deliberately not the quit path: quit evicts provider children and releases leases, and that is
// the state a restart test is checking gets re-derived from disk. It stops short of ownership.
//
// What it cannot skip is work already in flight, which is what every copy of this helper used to
// get wrong. Two producers reach the session store after the last awaited call has returned — a
// lease-renewal tick, and the restart the delivery loop wakes for an accepted send — and the store
// re-creates its own directory before every commit. A commit landing after the test removed its
// temp directory therefore puts that directory back, and the removal fails with ENOTEMPTY. Quit
// waits for both, in its `stop-lease-renewal` and `drain-attaches` phases; so does this.
