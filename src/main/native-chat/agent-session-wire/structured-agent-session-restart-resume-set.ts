// Which durable teardown witnesses are still offers.
//
// The marker IS the answer to "was this chat working" AND the description of what it was doing:
// teardown took both from the same check the sidebar shows, right before the chat's child was
// stopped. Nothing here re-reads the journal to second-guess it — once reattached, a provider
// rewrites that journal in its own words (a notice turn of its own, restated subagent rows, a
// restored thread), and every reading of those rewrites as "the work is done" dropped chats that
// were owed a resume.
//
// An offer ends when the chat moves on after the restart — another message accepted, or its agent
// started — or when the conversation forked. Both are reported back as `superseded` so the caller
// DELETES the record rather than filtering it forever. What remains are structural checks that are not about work at all: the record still
// exists and this build supports it, and the lease is free.
