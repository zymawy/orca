//
// A submission row is durable before dispatch, so after a crash the host knows
// what it TRIED to send but not whether the provider took it. Every surviving
// `pending` becomes `unknown` and is then matched against provider history.
//
// Matching is by identity only — an echoed client message id, else a provider
// item id the journal already adopted, else the payload fingerprint when it
// picks out exactly one unclaimed item. Never by text equality: the same
// question asked twice is two messages, and collapsing them silently loses one.
//
// Orca never re-sends on the user's behalf. An unresolved submission stays
// `unknown` — a displayed state meaning "delivery unconfirmed", neither sent nor
// failed — and the user chooses to resend or discard.
