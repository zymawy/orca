// Why a submission is `unknown` — the one state that admits it cannot tell.
//
// `unknown` is never raised by elapsed time; what survives is a process fact that
// ENDS THE WAIT without answering it. Nothing here proves a message reached a
// provider, and nothing here proves it did not: a fact that proves non-delivery
// is a rejection and lives in `structured-agent-session-dispatch-rejection.ts`.
//
// That leaves the invariant this file exists to state: Orca NEVER re-delivers a
// message under its own id on the strength of an `unknown`, whatever the reason
// says. A retry that could be a second delivery is the harm this whole path
// exists to remove, and a user who wants the message sent anyway rotates the id
// — one re-typed message, and a first delivery by construction.
