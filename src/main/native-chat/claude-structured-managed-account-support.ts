 * A structured Claude session launches against the ambient Claude config, which the account service
 * keeps in sync with the selected HOST account. A WSL-bound managed account lives inside the distro
 * and is never synced there, so such a session would authenticate as whatever the ambient identity
 * happens to be while the UI names the WSL account — the user is told one identity and given
 * another. Refuse the structured path there and let the terminal-backed one, which resolves the
 * account per runtime, handle that account shape.
 *
 * Reads the selection through the same accessor the auth policy uses. Resolving it any other way
 * lets the two disagree, and a session admitted by this gate would then run under a policy computed
 * from a different account than the one approved here.
 *
 * Unknown answers refuse, and only genuinely unknown ones: settings that cannot be read at all, or
 * an active selection this cannot resolve. An install with no managed accounts — the list empty or
 * never written — claims no identity and is fine.
