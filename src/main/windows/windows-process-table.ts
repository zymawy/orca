/**
 * The only place Orca reads the Windows process table.
 *
 * Every previous reader forked `powershell.exe` to run a `Get-CimInstance
 * Win32_Process` scan (with a `wmic` fallback that Windows 11 24H2 has
 * removed). Seven of them existed, on independent cadences. That is why:
 *
 * - a PowerShell Transcription policy recorded ~289 GB across 1.4 million
 *   files, because a scan ran every ~2 seconds (#15209);
 * - a Group Policy or AV block turned a process query into "unavailable",
 *   which callers read as "no evidence", which is how a PTY tree survived its
 *   own teardown (#9045, #10475);
 * - the scan cost ~700 ms and ran per pane, so panes multiplied it (#15036).
 *
 * A Toolhelp32 snapshot answers the same question in ~16 ms with no child
 * process at all, so none of those failure modes have anywhere to live.
 *
 * Two flag sets, because only some callers need a command line, and exactly one
 * native read in flight at a time, because the vendored wrapper coalesces
 * differing flags -- see docs/reference/windows-process-enumeration.md.
 *
 * Measured on Windows 11 (492 processes), p50 / p95:
 *   identity  pid+ppid+name         6.3 / 7.0  ms   0 OpenProcess
 *   detailed  +commandLine         12.3 / 13.4 ms   1 OpenProcess/process
 *   (retired) +memory +commandLine 13.1 / 14.1 ms   2 OpenProcess/process
 *   PowerShell CIM                  706 / 723  ms
 *
 * Dropping Memory removed the second per-process handle: it took an
 * OpenProcess(...|VM_READ) it never read through. CommandLine's own read is no
 * longer a PEB walk either -- the patched addon asks the kernel.
 *
 * Both Toolhelp32 rows predate `CreationTime`, which both flag sets now also
 * ask for and which is unmeasured here: it costs one
 * OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION) plus GetProcessTimes per
 * process, so identity no longer opens nothing at all -- but that pair is far
 * cheaper than either handle the rows above measure.
 *
 * All Toolhelp32 rows assume the optional `windows-process-tree.node` addon.
 * The desktop bundles it; no released relay carries it, so on an SSH host the
 * CIM row is the operative number and the child process is not avoided at all.
