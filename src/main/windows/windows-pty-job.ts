/**
 * Job-object ownership for a ConPTY's process tree.
 *
 * Before this, Orca answered "is this tree mine, and how do I kill it?" by
 * scraping the process table, walking parent pids back to itself, and then
 * running `taskkill /T /F` only if the walk said yes. Every step of that is a
 * guess:
 *
 * - a pid walk cannot survive pid reuse, so teardown had to refuse whenever it
 *   was unsure, and a refused kill is an orphaned agent tree holding the
 *   worktree directory open (#9045, #10475, #10087);
 * - a descendant that reparented is invisible to the walk entirely;
 * - the scrape itself could be blocked by policy, which read as "no evidence".
 *
 * A job object replaces the inference with a handle. node-pty puts each shell
 * into its own job at creation, before it can spawn anything, so membership is
 * the kernel's answer rather than ours.
 *
 * The job is not kill-on-close: it makes an explicit teardown exact, and
 * deliberately does not change what a clean shell exit means for anything the
 * user backgrounded.

 * the shell until `kill()` runs — see config/patches/node-pty@1.1.0.patch — but
 * the nulled job handle is what makes the answer null either way.)
 * Null therefore means "unverifiable" in the sense of

 * the terminal is not a ConPTY, or it is no longer tracked. It is never
 * evidence that processes died.

 * tracked: a pane whose shell is alive can be asked what is running under it,

/**
 * Put this process in a kill-on-close job so its descendants die with it.
 *
 * Why this is separate from the per-PTY jobs: those cannot carry
 * KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE, because their handle is released when the shell exits and
 * that would reap whatever the user had backgrounded. This one is released only
 * when the process itself dies, so it reaps a crashed host without changing
 * what a clean exit means. Children inherit membership, so the per-PTY jobs
 * nest inside it and every pty is covered.
 *
 * Call it from the pty spawn path, not from startup: resolving the native
 * module loads the ConPTY addon, and paying that before the daemon publishes
 * its endpoint delays readiness — the boot smoke test caught exactly that.
 *
 * Call it BEFORE the first pty. `AssignProcessToJobObject` adds only the named
 * process; children inherit membership, but a pty that already exists does not
 * join retroactively and would not be reaped.
 *
 * Call it from the terminal daemon, not from the app: an app-main crash must
 * still leave sessions alive, which is what win-crash-survival-e2e asserts. A
 * daemon death reaping its shells is the intended change (#9195, #10415).
 *
 * Returns false when the OS refuses -- an outer job that forbids nesting -- in
 * which case orphan behaviour is simply what it was before.
