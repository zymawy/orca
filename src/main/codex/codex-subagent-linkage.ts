// Who produced a Codex journal row, decided from the thread that carried it.
//
// Orca opens exactly one thread per app-server, so every other thread on the
// connection is one Codex spawned for a subagent. That settles WHETHER a row is
// a child's without waiting on anything: there is no root arm for another
// thread, announced or not, and its thread id is final from its first frame —
// unlike a tool-call reference, it is never re-minted. Only the parent and the
// run are learned from the roster's executions, and a later revision of the
// row picks them up when they arrive.
