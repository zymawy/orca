// How a durable session record becomes a Codex process launch.
//
// Every input is read back from the record the store already made durable, not
// from the call that triggered the acquire. A client that attaches twice must
// land in the same working directory under the same account home, and a resume
// must name the thread this session actually proved — never one a caller asks
// for, which is how a resume becomes a fork wearing a resume's name.
