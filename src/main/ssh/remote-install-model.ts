/**
 * The two things Orca installs into `~/.orca-remote/`, and the rules that keep them from
 * touching each other.
 *
 * `docs/design/shipping-orcad.html` §06 settles that on-disk coexistence is permanent: the
 * relay is the dumb execution host for SSH-target users, orcad is the peer for paired
 * environments, and no plan item retires either. So `relay-<version>/` and `orcad-<version>/`
 * sit side by side forever, and the namespace has to be a parameter rather than a literal.
 *
 * GC ownership is the trap that parameterization creates. Each model garbage-collects ONLY
 * its own directories — see `remoteInstallDirOwner`. Relay's regex happened to be narrow
 * enough already; making the prefix a parameter is exactly what could have widened it into
 * deleting a live orcad tree, so the ownership rule is asserted here rather than left to
 * whichever regex a caller passes.
