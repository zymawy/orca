/**
 * Starting a candidate orcad on the host and reading back what it says about itself.
 *
 * This is the piece `docs/design/shipping-orcad.html` §02 marks **fork**, not reuse: the
 * relay launches detached and proves itself by printing an `ORCA-RELAY` sentinel, and orcad
 * has no such interface. It publishes a single `orca_server_ready` JSON line on stdout,
 * carrying the health payload activation is gated on — so the handshake here is "capture
 * that line", not "match a marker".
 *
 * The candidate is launched detached with stdout redirected to a file inside its own version
 * directory. Reading readiness off the exec channel would mean holding the channel open for
 * the process's whole life; redirecting means the deploy can disconnect and the supervisor
 * still owns a running service.
