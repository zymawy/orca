/**
 * orcad's garbage collection, and the half of §06 falsifier 1 that says who owns it.
 *
 * **Each model GCs only its own namespace, permanently.** orcad removes `orcad-<v>/`
 * directories; the relay removes `relay-<v>/` directories; neither ever removes the other's,
 * and no plan item makes one the winner. That is not a migration compromise — the two models
 * serve different users on the same machine (SSH target vs paired peer), so there is no
 * moment at which one of them is entitled to clean up after the other. A pass that deleted
 * the sibling's tree would be reaching across the execution boundary the whole design exists
 * to keep intact.
 *
 * On top of the ownership rule, orcad pins three directories that are idle-looking but
 * load-bearing: the active version, the rollback target, and whichever version the LIVE
 * terminal daemon was forked from.
