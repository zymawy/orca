/**
 * The pre-activation copy of shared profile state that makes rollback sound.
 *
 * `docs/design/shipping-orcad.html` §04's state-schema row asks for "backward-readable
 * migrations or a pre-activation snapshot". Only the second is available here, and not as a
 * preference: Orca's persisted state carries **no schema version**. Migrations are cohort
 * and shape heuristics that run on load and rewrite in place, and the load path rebuilds
 * `settings` and `ui` from known fields — so a newer build's nested additions are silently
 * dropped by an older one rather than rejected. There is nothing to compare and nothing that
 * fails loudly, which rules out proving backward-readability and leaves the snapshot.
 *
 * What is snapshotted is deliberately narrow. `<root>/daemon` is EXCLUDED: it holds the live
 * daemon's socket, PID record and auth token, and that daemon outlives every orcad restart
 * by design. Restoring a stale copy of it over a running daemon would break the endpoint
 * fence that keeps its terminals adoptable — turning a rollback into the exact terminal
 * massacre the daemon exists to prevent.
