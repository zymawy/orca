/**
 * Keeps the remote relay's Unix socket path inside `sockaddr_un.sun_path`.
 *
 * The default endpoint is `$HOME/.orca-remote/relay-<fullVersion>/relay-<id>.sock`,
 * whose fixed suffix already costs ~66 bytes. A managed-hosting `$HOME` such as
 * `/var/www/<uuid>` pushes the whole path past the kernel cap and libuv reports only
 * `listen EINVAL`, so the relay never starts (#10726). When that happens the socket
 * moves to a fixed-length base whose length no longer depends on `$HOME`.
 *
 * Windows relays bind named pipes (`\\.\pipe\...`), which have no `sun_path` limit.
