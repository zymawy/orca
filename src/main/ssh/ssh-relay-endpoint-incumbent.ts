/**
 * Who currently owns a relay socket path, answered with host evidence.
 *
 * The client used to answer this by assumption: a failed `--connect` was read as "the relay
 * crashed", the socket was `rm -f`'d, and a fresh relay bound the same path. Unlinking a unix
 * socket does not close the listener the incumbent already holds, so an alive-but-refusing
 * relay (the `RelayVersionMismatchError` case, and the credential-rotation case) was left
 * running forever with its PTYs (#8585).
 *
 * The verdict vocabulary is fixed by docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md — `live` /
 * `unverifiable` / `exited`, with no synonyms and no collapsing. Two consequences are load
 * bearing here:
 *
 * - `exited` is a claim about **this endpoint**, not about every relay on the host. It means
 *   nothing holds this socket path, established positively (a connect that was refused *and*
 *   an enumeration that found no holder). A relay whose socket was already unlinked is
 *   invisible to this probe by construction — that is what the superseded sweep is for.
 * - a probe that could not run, a host without `lsof`, or a connect that failed for any other
 *   reason is `unverifiable`. It cannot authorize client cleanup; guarded launch still
 *   delegates socket takeover checks to the daemon.
