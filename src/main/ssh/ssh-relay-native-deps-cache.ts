/**
 * Where the relay's compiled native dependencies live, and what their identity is keyed on.
 *
 * A relay install directory is keyed on the JS bundle hash, which moves on every commit to
 * `src/relay/` or the `src/shared/` it pulls in. `node_modules` used to live inside it, so a
 * dependency set that is a pinned constant (`RELAY_NATIVE_DEPS`) was reinstalled — and on Linux,
 * where node-pty ships no prebuild, recompiled from source — on every new bundle (#18009). The
 * directory key was coupled to the wrong quantity.
 *
 * The tree now lives at `~/.orca-remote/native/<relayPlatform>-<depsHash>/node_modules` and each
 * relay directory holds a symlink to it. Three rules make one tree safe to share:
 *
 * 1. **A published entry is immutable.** `.deps-complete` is written last, only after a probe on
 *    this host loaded both addons. Nothing installs, rebuilds or resets into a published entry: a
 *    repair detaches the symlink and installs privately, so a host with a broken toolchain can
 *    never `rm -rf node_modules/node-pty` out from under a live relay that shares the tree.
 * 2. **Publication elects one winner with `mkdir`.** The entry either does not exist (this deploy
 *    builds it privately and promotes it) or is already complete (this deploy links it). There is
 *    no window in which two deploys write one tree, so no client-side lock is needed.
 * 3. **Every failure degrades to today's per-directory install.** A host that cannot symlink,
 *    cannot create the directory, or answers nothing still deploys, one bundle at a time.
 *
 * Windows is deliberately excluded. node-pty's npm tarball ships win32 prebuilts, so there is no
 * compile to avoid there, and `node-pty-1.1.0-console-list-agent-patch.cjs` mutates the installed
 * tree in place — which rule 1 forbids for a shared one.
 *
 * Linux's `node-pty-1.1.0-master-cloexec-patch.cjs` also mutates in place, but it stays inside rule
 * 1: the deploy path runs it before promotion, and returns early on a linked entry, so it only ever
 * touches a private tree. Its bytes are in the key, so a patched build never links a pre-patch
 * entry -- and a tree whose patch was refused or rolled back is not promoted at all, because under
 * that same key it would publish the leak to every later host on the machine.
