 *
 *  The silent no-ops are the safety rules, not defensive padding:
 *  - **reversible**: see above.
 *  - **no `connectionId`**: a local PTY's owner is this process, so a failed kill has no later host
 *    to ask; there is nothing to replay against.
 *  - **no incarnation on a legacy id**: a legacy relay renumbers from `pty-1` on every start, so
 *    without the host-minted incarnation the order could never be safely aimed. A `pty2:` id is
 *    epoch-scoped and names one process, so it is recorded without one.
 *  - **an id naming another connection**: `getRelayPtyId` throws on those, and this runs inside
 *    promise `.catch` handlers where that would surface as an unhandled rejection. */
