// `attachStablePaneOwner` is the last reader that synthesised a runtime exit from a reattach
// refusal, and it published code 0 — which `orca-runtime-on-pty-exit` records as a death
// certificate. The refusal it acts on is a union: `pty.attach` answers absent both for a pid the
// relay probed and found gone, and for an id its session map never had, which is every id minted
// before a relay restart. Certifying the union orphans a live remote shell and cold-starts a second
// agent onto its transcript (docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md).
//
// The sibling handlePtyReattachFailure has always refused to certify from that union. These pin the
// same rule here, and pin that the marked half — the one refusal the relay backed with a pid probe
// — still earns the certificate, so a genuinely dead PTY is not left `unverifiable` forever.
