/**
 * Guards the one line that arms pre-gone crash sampling.
 *
 * That branch is pure instrumentation, so this line is the whole of its value in
 * the shipped app: deleting it left all 691 tests across `src/main/crash-reporting/`
 * and `src/main/startup/` green while every crash report silently lost its only
 * host reading taken before the dying process returned its pages.
 *
 * Source-level because that is the property: the sampler is armed once inside the
 * ready-phase composition, which has no runtime seam to assert against.
