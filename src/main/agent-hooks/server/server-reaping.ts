   *  roster nothing can ever retire — the inventory reap needs the parent to emit a
   *  complete `background_tasks` list and an idle parent never does. The row then
   *  gates the pane 'working' for the rest of its life and hibernation, which
   *  requires 'done', can never reclaim the agent's heap.
