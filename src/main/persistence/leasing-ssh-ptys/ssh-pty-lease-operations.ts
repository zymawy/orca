 * `resolvePersistedStablePaneOwner` return null, so `adoptStablePane` gave up and `createTerminal`
 * spawned a replacement over a process that was still running. Keeping it buys a reattach ATTEMPT
 * only — a genuinely dead shell is retired by `attachStablePaneOwner` on the relay's own absence
 * answer, which then falls through to a fresh spawn.
 *
 * Supersession is the one place `expired` still scrubs a binding, and it does so explicitly in
 * `supersedeSiblingLeasesForPane`: there a NEWER lease for the same pane is the evidence.
