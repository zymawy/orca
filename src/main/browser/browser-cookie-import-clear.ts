 * callers that hand it a real Session — pinned by "serializes concurrent clears on the same
 * session" in the atomicity suite. It does NOT serialise the importer, because both import paths
 * build a fresh adapter object per call, so the key is new every time and this lock is a no-op for
 * them. That is deliberate and safe: the importer holds the real per-partition lock, keyed on the
 * Electron Session, across its whole clear-and-write transaction — a scope this function cannot
 * see. Do not remove the importer's outer lock on the assumption that this one covers it.
 *
 * Why (STA-4797): importScope is required, not defaulted. A default would be the whole jar again,
 * and the whole-jar clear is the defect — an import of three sites signed the user out of every
 * other site in the partition. Every caller has to name what it is about to replace.
