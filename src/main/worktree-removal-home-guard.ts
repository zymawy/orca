/**
 * Deciding whether a worktree-removal path is somebody's home directory — and

 *
 * `os.homedir()` answers for the process running Orca. A removal routed to an
 * SSH host deletes on a different machine, with a different OS and a different
 * home, so the client answer is neither necessary nor sufficient there: a
 * Windows host profile (`C:\Users\bob`) went unrecognised from a macOS desktop
 * and a coincidental client-home prefix could refuse a legitimate remote
 * delete (#18275). Callers therefore name the machine they mean, and the
 * ambient read is reachable only through `{ kind: 'client' }`.
 *
 * Everything else here is decided from path SYNTAX, which travels: a Windows
 * profile is a Windows profile no matter which desktop is looking at it.
