  // age differently: observedAt is the newest point in the 5-minute query

  // summed value is still complete. 330 s clears the worst of the three (the
  // 300 s query window) plus ~30 s of collect-to-evaluate latency. The old

  // Why: 320, recalibrated 2026-09-17 from 250. The auth instance sums seven
  // databases, and its steady load has grown past the 2026-08-26 measurement the
  // old bar came from. Measured latest-sum over the 24 h to 2026-09-17, aligned
  // per minute exactly as this signal reads it: p50 118 / p90 165 / p95 212 /
  // p99 262 / max 282. 250 was under the observed max, so 1.95% of minutes and
  // 21.8% of 15-minute pre-drain gates froze on ordinary load. 320 clears every
  // measured healthy minute with 13% of headroom above the peak and still fires
  // at 65% of the 490 connections the budget work (#21165) treats as usable out
  // of max_connections 500, so exhaustion-class growth is caught with 170
  // connections still in hand. The retry signals below discriminate incident-class
  // contention. Re-tighten when the auth connection model lands (#21165).
  cloudSqlBackends: 320,
  // Bound the observed recovery load; deadlocks remain zero-tolerance.
  cloudSqlLockWaits: 20,
  cloudSqlDeadlocks: 0,
  // Why: pool amplitude cannot discriminate the 2026-08-23 incident. Healthy
  // fleet-wide bursts reach 43 waiters / 2.03s waits several times an hour,
  // and a cell roll's reconnect surge peaks at 676 waiters, while the real
  // incident peaked at 356 waiters and never crossed 2.5s (waits cap ~2s
  // structurally). The old bars of 30/1000 froze pre-drain gates on baseline
  // noise (~17% per 15-minute window). Incident-class contention is caught by
  // the retry signals below at ~10x separation; these bars now fence only
  // genuinely unbounded queueing, which grows past both.
  relayPoolWaiting: 800,
  relayPoolWaitMs: 2_500,
  // Why: successful lock retries are the contention machinery working, not harm.
  // Recalibrated 2026-09-04 from 300, which was set 2026-08-26 when healthy bursts
  // reached 234/5min. The global relay_cells FOR UPDATE lock has since become the
  // fleet's steady state: measured fleet-wide (director + cells, summed per five
  // minutes) 2026-09-03T05Z..2026-09-04T05Z p50 430 / p90 924 / p99 1320 / max
  // 1504, with 55% of windows over 300 and only 22% of 15-minute gates clean, so
  // the bar blocked the very cell roll that carries the 500 ms lock wait (#18521)
  // and the beginProof crash guard to the cells. The 2026-08-23 lock incident on
  // this same metric peaked at 1510 in one window and 646 in the next, so it is
  // not separable from today's contention by retries alone; it is caught by
  // relayPostgresRetryExhausted (467 at the peak vs a 300 bar), director
  // concurrency, and the pool bars. 2000 passes every healthy 15-minute window
  // measured in the last 24 h and still fences unbounded growth. Re-tighten once
  // the fleet is on the 500 ms lock wait and the baseline is re-measured.
  relayPostgresRetries: 2000,
  // Why: 300 per five minutes, recalibrated 2026-09-04 from a bar of zero that no
  // production window has cleared since #18521 shipped to the director. That
  // change cut the request-path cell-inventory wait from the 1 s pool lock_timeout
  // to 500 ms, so a contended waiter now fails fast (one /v1/assign 503 with
  // Retry-After, which the client retries) instead of succeeding slowly, and the
  // exhaustion count became a steady-state contention rate rather than an
  // anomaly. Measured fleet-wide (director + cells) per five minutes over
  // 2026-09-03T03Z..2026-09-04T02Z: every one of 236 windows was non-zero;
  // quiet hours p50 2 / max 36; pre-#18521 daytime p50 10 / p90 25 / max 87;
  // post-#18521 p50 42 / p90 147 / max 220. The 2026-08-23 lock incident peaked
  // at 467. 300 clears every measured healthy window and still sits below the
  // incident shape; retries above fence only unbounded growth.
  // User-facing /v1/assign 503 share did not move with #18521 (13.9% old image
  // vs 12.3% new, same evening), so exhaustion is not a proxy for user harm.
  relayPostgresRetryExhausted: 300,
  // Why: public admission is a per-instance semaphore, so fleet assignment capacity is
  // concurrency x instances. A floor of 1 let the 2026-08-04 collapse from five instances
  // to two pass unnoticed, which is the exact failure this monitor exists to catch. Keep in
  // step with relay_min_instances in infra/terraform/environments/production.tfvars.

  // Why: 15, recalibrated 2026-09-17 from 3. This counts non-503 5xx answers from
  // the director over the rolling five-minute query window; 503s are excluded
  // because they are the documented back-pressure answer a client retries.
  // Measured over the 24 h to 2026-09-17 (272 non-503 5xx against 71 941 503s):
  // p50 0 / p90 3 / p95 5 / p99 9 / max 52. A bar of 3 sits at the p90, so 9.2%
  // of windows and 29.0% of 15-minute pre-drain gates froze on the chronic 500
  // bursts that /v1/assign, /v1/regions and /v1/resolve emit alongside the
  // recurring Cloud SQL stall. 15 clears the chronic p99 with margin and drops
  // the baseline gate-freeze rate to 1.5%, while leaving the exceptional 20-52
  // bursts detectable. A director that is actually broken answers 5xx on a large
  // share of its traffic: it serves ~50 requests a minute in 503s alone, so a
  // real fault lands in the hundreds per window, an order of magnitude clear of
  // this bar.
  directorErrors: 15,
  authErrors: 0,
  // Why: 800 exceeded the 600 hard cap, so this could never trigger on a capped cell. 500 is

  cellConnections: 500,

  migrationBlocked: 0,
  // Why: one sample is one HTTP round trip from one GitHub runner to one cell, so

  // The asia-east2 cells' readiness probe runs SELECT 1 against Cloud SQL in
  // us-central1 over a 176 ms round trip behind a 2 s statement timeout, so a
  // saturated pool makes the load balancer answer "no healthy upstream" for about
  // 30 s. That answer is an HTTP 503, not a transport failure, so provenance
  // cannot separate it from a cell that genuinely serves health=0 -- persistence
  // can. At the 60 s sample interval a 30 s outage shows up in one sample and at
  // worst two, so a cell's probe must fail more than this many consecutive samples
  // before it freezes the run. The streak is per cell, not per signal, so a cell
  // that alternates between slow and unanswered still accumulates one. This applies
  // to per-cell probes and the director instance count; the director and auth health
  // probes stay at zero tolerance.
