// The eleven periodic assignment sweeps the director runs every 30s. Each step
// re-derives its state from the database and is idempotent, so they carry no
// intra-tick ordering dependency — which is what makes per-step isolation
// sound: one failing sweep costs one tick of itself, never the other ten.
// (A single poisoned rehome row once silenced the whole chained form
// fleet-wide.) Sweep failures are logged, never fed into the rehome worker's
// dispatch-failure budget: a sweep exception is not a dispatch failure and
// must not durably disable regional rehoming.
