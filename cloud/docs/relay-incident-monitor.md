# Relay incident monitor

Status: monitor core and dedicated identity boundaries are implemented locally;
the targeted production bootstrap and live negative-permission proof remain
required before dispatch.

This monitor is read-only. It probes Relay endpoints and reads Cloud Monitoring, Compute
inventory, and authenticated aggregate director status. It does not drain, restart, resize,
deploy, change admission, or write to Google Cloud.

## Production workflow

Run `Monitor Relay Production` manually. Choose:

- `dry-run` for the required 15-minute pre-drain gate.
- `monitor` for a 90-minute incident watch.

Use the default `strict` migration policy for ordinary mutations. Select
`recover-forward` only after a drain attempt has durably registered migrations
and enter its exact existing-only recovery source cell. Recovery evidence tolerates
only the aggregate count of registered migrations whose target control is not
currently active for that source. Blocked or expired/unregistered migrations and every other
health threshold remain unchanged.

Enter the exact selector generation and all three disjoint membership sets:
`existing-only`, `migration-only`, and `general`. Every configured cell must
appear exactly once. Generation zero is the only mode that reads the legacy
boolean admission field; selector-era generations use only the durable
tri-state membership. Any generation or membership mismatch freezes the gate.
The workflow verifies dependencies and restored evidence before
authentication. It has no shared-deploy fallback and accepts only the dedicated
monitor provider and service-account production environment variables. Do not
dispatch it until the targeted identity bootstrap is applied and its live
negative-permission checks pass.

The job polls every 60 seconds and writes private aggregate evidence at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75,
and 90 minutes where applicable. It uploads state JSON, checkpoint JSONL, and Markdown for 14
days. No tokens, request bodies, logs, user IDs, host IDs, or relay device IDs are recorded.
Reruns keep one stable incident ID, restore the immediately preceding private
artifact, verify its commit/run/attempt provenance and content hashes, and pass
`--restart`. A missing or mismatched artifact fails closed. A missing, stale,
or collector-failed sample is durably recorded. Up to two consecutive such
samples per source are tolerated and the window keeps running; a third resets
the active continuous window, and the next fresh sample starts a new 15- or
90-minute window under the same incident lineage. A pre-drain dry run must reach
a verdict within 35 minutes of its lineage start.

Exit code `2` means the gate froze or a dry run failed. Missing, stale, malformed, unauthorized, or
unavailable telemetry fails closed.

## Gate override (break-glass)

`Deploy Relay Production Same-Cap` can skip this 15-minute dry-run gate. Supply both
`gate-override-reason` and `gate-override-confirmation`, where the confirmation is exactly
`SKIP_RELAY_MONITOR_GATE <target-image-digest>`. Supplying one without the other, a
confirmation bound to any other digest, or a reason shorter than 12 characters fails the
run before it touches production. `verify` mode rejects the override outright.

### When it is legitimate

The gate proves the fleet is healthy before a wave mutates it. That proof is the wrong
question in exactly two situations.

- **The roll is the fix for the measured condition.** When a chronic fault is the reason
  the gate freezes, waiting for a green 15-minute window means waiting for the condition
  the wave removes. On 2026-09-17 the gate froze 44 consecutive times on the recurring
  Cloud SQL stall the rolling image addresses.
- **An incident where the director is healthy.** Rolling back off a bad image should not
  wait 15 minutes for aggregate evidence about a fleet the operator is already watching.

It is not a way to move faster on an ordinary wave. Use it when you can name the signal
the gate is freezing on and say why this wave is the answer to it.

### What it does not skip

Only the aggregate 15-minute dry-run and its sealed evidence are skipped. Every other
control still runs, unchanged:

- The live per-wave preflight, against the same thresholds this document lists. With no
  sealed state to read, the expected selector comes from the dispatch inputs instead, and
  the migration policy is pinned to `strict`. That membership is canonicalised exactly as
  the monitor canonicalises its own, so it must still name every configured cell exactly
  once and the order you type it in does not matter. A live threshold breach or selector
  mismatch still fails the wave before any mutation.
- Durable regional rehome disabled, and the exact selector generation and membership,
  verified against the live director.
- The reviewed Terraform plan, the exact image digest served by Artifact Registry, the
  predecessor runtime check, and the new-incarnation check.
- One cell at a time behind the Cloud SQL rollout lease, with the failed-wave failsafe
  that leaves a cell isolated.
- Single-dispatch mutation: a re-run still cannot replay a wave.

### The audit trail

Three places record it, and none of them depend on the operator writing anything down:

- The workflow run's inputs, kept by GitHub for the life of the run.
- The gate job's run summary: actor, mode, cells, target digest, reason, and confirmation.
- The sealed canary artifact, under `gateOverride`, for a `canary-apply` wave.

The canary authority a later batch verifies never carried a monitor run ID, so a batch can
reuse a canary that was rolled under an override. The override is recorded in that
artifact as audit trail, not as authority: each wave is authorized by its own confirmation.

## Local use

The active `gcloud` identity must be a service account that can mint an ID token for the exact
audience `https://relay.onorca.dev/v1/admin/drain`, and it needs read access to the monitored GCP
resources. A user account normally needs Token Creator on an approved service account.

For a short run, an already minted JWT may instead be supplied through
`ORCA_RELAY_ADMIN_ID_TOKEN`. The token must remain valid for the whole run and is never persisted.
Use refreshable service-account credentials for the 90-minute mode.

```sh
pnpm incident:relay -- \
  --environment production \
  --incident-id relay-incident-20260728 \
  --expected-selector-generation 2 \
  --expected-existing-only-cells production-gce-c1 \
  --expected-migration-only-cells production-gce-c2 \
  --expected-general-cells production-gce-c3,production-gce-c4,production-gce-c5,production-gce-c6
```

Add `--pre-drain-dry-run --duration-minutes 15` for an ordinary gate. Add
`--migration-policy recover-forward --recovery-source-cell-id <source>` only
for a committed forward-recovery gate. Durable files default to
`.relay-incidents/`. If the process stops, rerun the identical command with `--restart`. A runner
gap resets the active window at the next fresh sample and preserves the prior
window evidence. A threshold freeze never clears automatically.

A signal that reads missing or stale may miss up to two consecutive samples
without restarting the window. The sample still counts and is still checked
against every threshold it can read, and each tolerated gap is recorded in
`continuityEvents` with `tolerated: true`. A third consecutive miss of the same
signal, a failed collector, a runner gap, or any threshold breach restarts or
freezes as before.

A production candidate or multi-target mutation must download the exact
dry-run artifact by workflow run ID and attempt. It verifies the artifact
hashes and provenance, requires a green completed 15-minute state no older
than ten minutes (plus 75 minutes per predecessor same-cap wave), then
rechecks the live selector and one complete fresh sample of every safety
signal immediately before running the mutation command.
The signed state binds `strict` evidence to ordinary mutations and
`recover-forward` evidence to the exact recover-forward source; neither can
authorize the other.
The monitor and mutation jobs share one production lock. A passing dry-run is
durably marked consumed before mutation and cannot authorize another run.

## Freeze thresholds

| Signal | Freeze condition |
| --- | ---: |
| Active probe age | over 60 seconds |
| Cloud Monitoring data age | over 330 seconds |
| Relay log and director admin data age | over 180 seconds |
| Cell heartbeat age | over 45 seconds |
| Endpoint latency | over 2,000 ms |
| Cloud SQL CPU | over 80% |
| Cloud SQL memory | over 90% |
| Cloud SQL backends | over 320 (65% of the 490 usable of `max_connections` 500) |
| Cloud SQL waiting backends | over 20 |
| Cloud SQL deadlocks | over 0 |
| Relay pool waiters | over 800 |
| Relay pool wait | over 2,500 ms |
| PostgreSQL retries in five minutes | over 2,000 |
| Exhausted PostgreSQL retries in five minutes | over 300 |
| Director instances | outside 5–6 for more than two consecutive samples |
| Director CPU or memory | over 80% |
| Director concurrency | over 64 |
| Unexpected director 5xx in five minutes (excludes 503) | over 15 |
| Auth 5xx in five minutes | over 0 |
| Connections per cell process | over 500 |
| Queued bytes per cell process | over 48 MiB |
| Blocked or expired/unregistered migration | over 0 |
| Registered migration with inactive target | over 0, except in `recover-forward` evidence |

Expected enabled cells must also have a powered runtime, healthy and ready endpoints, fresh
heartbeats, and matching live admission.

Two readings are the exception to the freeze-on-first-breach rule above.

A cell's endpoint readings are the first. Health, ready and latency are a single HTTP
round trip from one runner, so they must fail more than two consecutive samples before
they freeze the run; the streak is keyed by cell, so one cell's three readings share it.

The director instance count is the second. Cloud Run replaces an instance in place
rather than holding the count, so the reading leaves the band for about one sample
roughly twice a day, and a deploy that briefly serves two revisions raises it the same
way. Neither is an unhealthy fleet. The minimum and maximum share one streak, so a count
that alternates above and below the band still freezes the run.

Absorbed breaches are recorded in the state artifact under `toleratedProbeEvents`. Every
other signal, including the director and auth health probes, freezes on the first bad
sample. The live preflight that runs before each mutating wave re-samples on the same
tolerance.

## Region placement alert policies

Cloud Monitoring alert policies, not monitor freeze bars: these page from
`cloud/infra/terraform/relay-observability.tf` on the shared relay channel in
`relay_alert_notification_channels`, and they do not gate any workflow. All
three exist because US desktops sat on asia-east2 cells for weeks in 2026-08
with every existing bar green.

| Alert policy | Condition |
| --- | ---: |
| Orca Relay: far-cell phone accept latency | per cell, median 30-second `clientAcceptTotalMsP95` over 15 minutes above 2,000 ms with at least 20 completed accepts |
| Orca Relay: cell control round trip | per cell, median `controlRttMsP50` over one hour above 150 ms with at least 500 samples |
| Orca Relay: region hint skew | fleet-wide, asia-east2 share of hinted requests over one hour more than 2x and more than 15 points above its share of actual placements, with at least 500 hinted requests |

Threshold basis:

- Accept latency. An in-region phone accept completes in 0.3-0.6 s and a
  cross-Pacific one in 5-10 s, so 2,000 ms sits outside in-region noise and
  well under the far-cell floor. The 20-accept minimum keeps one slow accept
  on a quiet cell off the pager. The p95 is the published value, so the
  window aggregate is its median, not its max.
- Control round trip. In-region is tens of milliseconds; a US desktop on an
  asia-east2 cell is 200 ms or more. Only the p50 is used. The desktop echoes
  the pong on its main thread, so the published p95 and max track renderer
  stalls rather than distance. 500 samples per hour is about two
  continuously connected hosts at the 15-second control ping. Tuning risk: EU
  desktops on us-central1 sit at 100-130 ms, so a cell whose population is
  mostly European can approach the bar while correctly homed. Check where the
  hosts are before reading a first breach as mis-homing.
- Region hint skew. This compares two shares of the same hour rather than
  testing one absolute share, because an absolute bar is wrong at both ends.
  Measured over twelve hours on 2026-09-07, while the desktop region probe
  was still mis-picking: asia-east2 was 33.8% of the 33,800 hinted requests
  and only 7.9% of the 45,364 assignments, a divergence of 4.27x and a gap of
  25.9 points. A fixed 40% bar would have stayed silent through that, and
  once the probe is fixed the genuine APAC share climbs past any such bar and
  pages forever on the correct end state. The 2x and 15-point bars sit inside
  the broken state and outside a healthy one. `unhinted` requests are
  excluded from the denominator: they were 27% of all requests, so a client
  change that always sends a hint would move the number with no behaviour
  change at all. The two bars are cross-multiplied rather than divided. An
  hour that placed nobody in the region is the most extreme skew there is,
  and it happens whenever the region is drained, fenced, or at capacity, but
  dividing by that zero placement share makes MQL drop the row and lose the
  series before any other clause runs.

Expect the skew alert to stay lit after a client fix until the mis-homed
backlog is rehomed. Sticky assignment never re-consults the hint, so a
desktop already on an asia cell keeps being placed there whatever it now
asks for; the ratio clears only once the rehome sweep has drained.

All three conditions are written in MQL rather than the metric filters the
other relay policies use. Every runtime metric is a DELTA DISTRIBUTION, and
the only scalar aligners a filter condition can apply to one are percentiles;
each of these alerts needs the sum of the extracted values as a volume floor,
which is `sum(value.<metric>)` in MQL and unreachable otherwise. None of the
metrics they read exists in the project yet, so what was checked against
production is the query shape: the same MQL run over existing metrics of the
same kind confirmed the distribution sum, the join arity, the unit literals,
and the condition clause.

The skew shares are built from one log-based metric per region for hints and
one per region for placements. They read flat `requestedRegion<Region>Delta`
and `selectedRegion<Region>Delta` fields that the relay publishes as zeros in
every interval, not the nested region maps: a log-based metric would need a
quoted field path to reach a hyphenated map key, and an absent key would drop
a series out of the inner join. The region list lives in Terraform as
`relay_region_keys` and is pinned to relay-contract's `RELAY_REGIONS` by
`dev/scripts/relay-region-hint-metrics.test.mjs`. Both sides spell the field
name segments out as literal maps rather than deriving them, so the same test
compares the two declarations directly. Adding a region to the contract
without its segment is a compile error in relay-contract, not a silent gap.

## Relay lock contention alert policies

Two paging policies in `cloud/infra/terraform/relay-observability.tf` alert the
relay channel when one transaction holds the relay cell table long enough to
stall the fleet. `Orca Relay: cell table lock held over 1 second` fires on any
30-second runtime sample from a cell whose `cellInventoryHoldMsMax` is at least
1,000 ms, labelled with the cell's `cell_id`. `Orca Relay: lock timeout burst`
fires when Postgres cancels at least 20 relay statements in one minute for
waiting out their lock timeout. Auth traffic on the shared instance and
fail-fast refusals from background sweeps are excluded. Replayed over
2026-09-20 14:00 to 2026-09-22 15:00 UTC, the cell hold policy matched all 93
holds from asia-east2 rehome commits, about 3.6 s each, and every one of the 88
burst minutes overlapped one of them. First response to either alert: if a
cell hold names an asia-east2 cell, pause regional rehoming through
`Operate Relay Production Rehome` with action `pause`.

Director holds of 1-2.5 s recur a few times a day even with rehoming paused.
They go to `Orca Relay: director cell table lock held over 1 second`, which has
no notification channel. If the burst alert fires with no cell hold in the same
minute, look at that director policy rather than pausing rehome; on 2026-09-23
at 04:23 UTC a 2,457 ms director hold produced 25 cancels while rehoming was
paused. Do not drain or restart cells for a director hold. A cell that has
stopped reporting emits no hold sample, so these policies catch lock convoys,
not outages.

## Implementation log

- Gave `collector_failed` the same two-consecutive-sample tolerance as an unread
  signal and raised the pre-drain lineage cap from 25 to 35 minutes
  (2026-09-17). Basis: dry-run 35258662628 sampled a healthy fleet clean for
  13 minutes, then a single unreadable Cloud Monitoring sample restarted the
  window, and the restarted window ran past the 25-minute cap at 1 500 002 ms,
  so a healthy fleet produced no verdict. One failed collector round trip is
  evidence about that round trip, not about the fleet, and it cannot freeze the
  gate on its own because it carries no threshold breach. `monitor_gap` keeps
  zero tolerance: it means the run stopped sampling, so the window has a real
  hole. 35 minutes fits a 15-minute window plus one restart: a reset on the
  window's last sample restarts at minute 16 and finishes at 31. The job
  timeout is already 100 minutes.
- Recalibrated the Cloud SQL backends freeze from 250 to 320, the unexpected
  director 5xx freeze from 3 to 15, and gave per-cell endpoint probes a
  two-consecutive-sample tolerance (2026-09-17). Basis: the pre-roll dry-run had
  frozen 39 times out of 39, every time on a chronic production condition
  unrelated to the roll it gates, so it was adding delay rather than safety.
  Measured over the 24 h to 2026-09-17 through the Cloud Monitoring API with the
  monitor's own aggregation. `cloud_sql.backends` latest-sum per minute: p50 118 /
  p90 165 / p95 212 / p99 262 / max 282, so the old bar of 250 sat under the
  observed peak and tripped 1.95% of minutes and 21.8% of 15-minute gates; 320
  clears every healthy minute with 13% headroom and still fires at 65% of the 490
  usable connections, leaving 170 in hand for the runaway that exhaustion actually
  is. `director.errors` non-503 5xx per rolling five minutes: p50 0 / p90 3 /
  p95 5 / p99 9 / max 52, so the old bar of 3 sat on the p90 and froze 9.2% of
  windows and 29.0% of gates on the chronic `/v1/assign`, `/v1/regions` and
  `/v1/resolve` 500 bursts that accompany the recurring Cloud SQL stall; 15 clears
  the chronic p99, drops the gate-freeze rate to 1.5%, and deliberately leaves the
  exceptional 20-52 bursts detectable. The director serves roughly 50 requests a
  minute in 503s alone, so a genuinely broken director lands in the hundreds per
  window. For the cell probes, the asia-east2 cells run readiness as `SELECT 1`
  against Cloud SQL in us-central1 over a 176 ms round trip behind a 2 s timeout,
  so a saturated pool makes the load balancer answer "no healthy upstream" for
  about 30 s; 7 of the last 14 freezes were that. It arrives as a real HTTP 503, so
  provenance cannot separate it from a cell serving `health=0` and persistence has
  to: at the 60 s interval it spans one sample and at worst two. The streak is
  keyed by cell rather than by signal, because keyed per signal a cell that
  alternates between slow and unanswered holds every streak at one and never
  reaches the tolerance. The live preflight before each mutating wave re-samples on
  the same tolerance, so a blip cannot fail a wave there either. Thresholds stay
  code constants sealed into every checkpoint rather than workflow inputs, so a
  green run stays auditable. Re-tighten the backends bar when the auth connection
  model lands (#21165).
- Recalibrated the relay pool freezes from 30 waiters / 1,000 ms to
  800 waiters / 2,500 ms (2026-08-27). Basis, measured from
  `orca_relay_runtime_metrics` (`databasePoolWaitersMax`,
  `databasePoolWaitMsMax`): healthy fleet-wide bursts reach 43 waiters and
  2.03 s several times an hour (52 burst-minutes over three days), a cell
  roll's reconnect surge peaks at 676 waiters, and the 2026-08-23 incident
  peaked at 356 waiters without ever crossing 2.5 s — amplitude does not
  separate incident from routine operation in either direction, and a
  15-minute gate had roughly one-in-six odds of freezing on a burst. The
  retry signals discriminate that incident at ~10x separation and keep their
  thresholds; the pool bars now fence only unbounded queueing.
- Recalibrated the Cloud SQL backends freeze from 160 to 250 (2026-08-26).
  Basis, measured from `cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/postgresql/num_backends`
  latest-sum over 24 healthy hours: mean ~100, 1-minute spikes to 216, with
  10 minutes over the old bar of 160 — enough to freeze roughly one in ten
  15-minute pre-drain gates on baseline noise. 250 cleared the healthy peaks
  measured then and still fired well before the 400-connection ceiling assumed at
  the time (the live instance measured 500 on 2026-09-16);
  pool waiters and pool wait latency keep their strict thresholds. Superseded by
  the 2026-09-17 entry above, which re-measured a grown baseline against the
  490-connection budget.
- Recalibrated the PostgreSQL-retry freeze from 20 to 300 per five minutes
  (2026-08-26). Basis, measured from
  `jsonPayload.event="orca_relay_postgres_transaction_retry"` in production
  logs: healthy-day bursts reach 234/5min with zero exhausted retries and 26%
  of five-minute windows over 20, while the 2026-08-23 lock-contention
  incident ran roughly 2,200–3,000/5min by raw log-line count (the gate's
  own `orca_relay_postgres_retries` metric read 1,510 for that window; see the
  2026-09-04 entry).
- Recalibrated the PostgreSQL-retry freeze from 300 to 2,000 per five minutes
  (2026-09-04). Basis: the global `relay_cells FOR UPDATE` lock made
  successful retries a steady-state rate. Measured fleet-wide (director +
  cells, summed per five minutes from the `orca_relay_postgres_retries`
  log metric) over 2026-09-03T05Z..2026-09-04T05Z: p50 430 / p90 924 /
  p99 1,320 / max 1,504; 55% of windows over 300; only 22% of 15-minute gates
  clean at 300 versus 100% at 2,000. Three read-only dry-runs on 2026-09-04
  froze on this bar (runs 33836470590, 33838698725) or on a genuine six-cell
  crash storm (33837160275), blocking the same-cap roll that carries #18521
  and the `beginProof` crash guard to the 23 cells. The 2026-08-23 incident
  on this metric peaked at 1,510 then 646, so retries alone no longer
  separate it from today's baseline; the exhausted-retry bar (incident peak
  467 vs bar 300), director concurrency, and the pool bars carry that role.
  Re-tighten after the fleet is on the 500 ms lock wait.
- Raised the Cloud Monitoring freshness bar from 180 s to 330 s and let a
  freshness-only failure miss up to two consecutive samples without restarting
  the window (2026-09-05). Basis: Google's metric list documents Cloud Run
  `request_count`, `container/instance_count`, `container/cpu/utilizations`,
  `container/memory/utilizations` and `container/max_request_concurrencies` as
  "Sampled every 60 seconds. After sampling, data is not visible for up to 120
  seconds", and Cloud SQL `database/cpu/utilization`,
  `database/memory/utilization`, `database/postgresql/num_backends`,
  `database/postgresql/backends_in_wait` and `database/postgresql/deadlock_count`
  as "up to 165 seconds", so the newest visible point is up to 180 s and 225 s
  old respectively. Window-sum signals age further: `observedAt` is the newest
  point in the 5-minute query window, so a label series that stops emitting
  reads as 300 s old while its summed value is complete. The old bar sat under
  all three. Production on 2026-09-04/05 restarted healthy 15-minute windows at
  181 s and 255 s (`auth.errors`, run 33928912676) and at 189 s
  (`cloud_sql.lock_waits`, run 33944873727), and the last of those then blew the
  25-minute lineage cap at 1 500 004 ms, so a green fleet produced no verdict.
  The director admin bar stays at 180 s and the nonzero lock-wait carry window
  stays at 180 s; both publish on our own cadence.
- Recalibrated the exhausted-PostgreSQL-retry freeze from 0 to 300 per five
  minutes (2026-09-04). Basis: #18521 cut the request-path cell-inventory
  lock wait from the 1 s pool `lock_timeout` to 500 ms, so contended waiters
  now fail fast (one `/v1/assign` 503 with `Retry-After`) instead of
  succeeding slowly, and `orca_relay_postgres_transaction_exhausted` became
  a steady contention rate. Measured fleet-wide per five minutes over
  2026-09-03T03Z..2026-09-04T02Z: 236 of 236 windows non-zero; quiet hours
  p50 2 / max 36; pre-#18521 daytime p50 10 / p90 25 / max 87; post-#18521
  p50 42 / p90 147 / max 220; the 2026-08-23 incident peaked at 467. Every
  pre-drain dry-run since the director deploy froze at minute one on this
  bar, which blocked the cell roll that carries the same fix to the 23 GCE
  cells. `/v1/assign` 503 share was unchanged by #18521 (13.9% vs 12.3%).
- Added a fail-closed state machine with latched threshold freezes,
  generation-scoped checkpoint boundaries, continuity-reset evidence, cadence
  accounting, restart-gap recovery, and the 15-minute pre-drain gate.
- Added Cloud Monitoring, active-probe, relay runtime, and authenticated director collectors.
- Added exact Cloud SQL instance and Cloud Run service filters, five-minute
  DELTA aggregation, and serialized aggregate admin reads so monitoring cannot
  load the director's three-connection database pool.
- Added private atomic state, idempotent JSONL checkpoints, and secret-safe Markdown evidence.
- Added the manual production workflow. It has not been dispatched.

### Director error allowance (2026-09-12)

The serving-cell rollout observed three unexpected director 500 responses among approximately 33,600 responses in an hour, all two-second PostgreSQL connection timeouts. CPU remained near 30–37% and the zero-error bar repeatedly prevented any cell mutation. The five-minute allowance was set to three non-503 director 5xx here, and was superseded by the 2026-09-17 recalibration to 15 recorded above. Auth errors, data freshness, active probes, SQL/pool pressure and other limits are unchanged. This is a bounded operational allowance, not a calibrated SLO or proof that intermittent failures are resolved; persistent low-frequency errors below this limit still require diagnosis.
