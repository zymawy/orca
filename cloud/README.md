# Orca Relay

The relay that connects the Orca mobile app to a desktop host. Phones and
desktops never talk to each other directly: each opens an outbound WebSocket
to a relay cell, the relay pairs the two sessions, and it splices frames
between them. A director assigns hosts to cells and coordinates migrations;
cells carry the user connections.

This directory is an independent pnpm workspace inside the Orca monorepo. Run
its commands from `cloud/`, not the repository root. The source is covered by
the repository's root [MIT license](../LICENSE).

## Packages

- `packages/relay-contract`: the wire contract shared by the relay, the
  desktop app, and the mobile app (frame shapes, close codes, admission budgets,
  splice state machine).
- `apps/relay`: the relay server. The same image runs as a director or a cell
  depending on `ORCA_RELAY_ROLE`.
- `apps/relay-fence-broker`: a private, IAM-only service that owns the durable
  mutation lease, the Terraform checkout, and the narrow Compute mutation used
  when a registered target is superseded. The workflow that calls it holds read
  and invoke rights only, never those mutation permissions.
- `apps/relay-ops`: the relay operations console and the incident monitor
  behind `pnpm ops:relay`, `pnpm incident:relay`, and
  `pnpm incident:relay-preflight`.
- `apps/push` and `packages/push-contract`: the mobile push gateway that holds
  the APNs key and sends to phones through APNs and FCM, and its wire contract.
  It is deployed and operated from here but is not part of the relay data path;
  see [docs/push-gateway.md](docs/push-gateway.md).

## Mobile push gateway

`apps/push` is a separate Cloud Run service from the relay. Phones never hold an
Orca credential for it: the desktop host authenticates with the same X25519
key it uses for the relay, answering an encrypted challenge to mint a 24 hour
session, then registers each paired phone's native push token and asks the
gateway to push. The gateway queues each event as its own notification,
enforces per-host quotas and request limits, and retires a
registration as soon as Apple or Google reports the token unregistered.
Provider push is the only ordinary mobile OS-banner path. The notification
socket is retained only for live dismissal and reconnect tray reconciliation;
it never creates or recovers banners. Desktop notification categories remain
authoritative.
Each delivery is persisted as one notification event. Before deploying an
incompatible queue format, stop all older push gateway revisions and clear only
unpublished push delivery fixtures; no queue preservation or migration is required.
FCM notification messages are inherently collapsible while offline and have a
small concurrent collapse-key budget, so every pending alert is not guaranteed.

Storage follows the relay pattern: PostgreSQL in production, SQLite for tests
and local development. Configure it with `ORCA_PUSH_PUBLIC_URL`, `ORCA_PUSH_FCM_PROJECT_ID`,
`ORCA_PUSH_DATABASE_URL`, the three APNs variables (`ORCA_PUSH_APNS_KEY`,
`ORCA_PUSH_APNS_KEY_ID`, `ORCA_PUSH_APPLE_TEAM_ID`, all three or none), and
optionally `ORCA_PUSH_APNS_TOPIC`. The FCM credential comes from
the runtime service account, so no key material is configured for Android. See
[push gateway operations](docs/push-gateway.md) for deployment and recovery.

Logging is aggregate counters only. Tokens, notification titles, notification
bodies, and full host fingerprints never reach a log line.

## Infrastructure and operations

- `infra/terraform`: the relay Terraform root. It owns the cells, the director,
  the shared Cloud SQL instance, DNS, observability, and every GitHub Workload
  Identity provider the relay workflows authenticate through. `backend/` holds
  the per-environment backend configuration and `environments/` the tfvars.
  Drive it through `pnpm infra:init`, `pnpm infra:plan`, and `pnpm infra:apply`.
- `dev/scripts`: the deploy, capacity, admission, rehome, monitoring, and load
  scripts the workflows call, plus the contract tests that pin each workflow
  and Terraform surface. Run them with `pnpm test`.
- `dev/contracts` and `dev/fixtures`: the checked-in data those contract tests
  read, including the Terraform root partition.
- `docs/`: the relay runbooks, capacity-testing guide, incident-monitor
  reference, the workflow variable reference in `docs/relay-workflows.md`, and
  the push gateway runbook in `docs/push-gateway.md`.

## Workflows

The 25 `.github/workflows/cloud-*.yml` workflows are the deploy and operate
surface: publish and deploy the director, roll GCE cell capacity, operate Asia
admission and regional rehoming, prove staging capacity, monitor production,
power staging up and down, and deploy the mobile push gateway.
`.github/actions/cloud-sql-rollout-lease` is the compare-and-swap lease that
serializes rollouts against the shared Cloud SQL instance. Push reuses that
action with its own lease object and deployment concurrency group.

Every one of them is inert. Each top-level job is gated on
`vars.ORCA_CLOUD_OPERATIONS_ENABLED == 'true'`, a repository variable that is
unset here, so the two scheduled triggers and every manual dispatch skip
without running a step. Only the repository owner, holding the GCP identities
these workflows authenticate as, can turn them on.

`Cloud Verify` is not gated. It builds, typechecks, lints, tests, secret-scans,
and validates the relay Terraform on every change under `cloud/`, and it runs
on fork pull requests, so it configures no backend and holds no credential.

## What is not here

The `terraform-foundation` and `terraform-apps` roots and the API and auth
services live in the private `stablyai/orca-cloud` repository. Scripts and
tests that spanned both trees were narrowed to the relay side rather than
carrying a dangling reference.

## Local development

```sh
cd cloud
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

`pnpm test` runs the SQLite-backed suites. Tests that need PostgreSQL run only
when `ORCA_RELAY_TEST_POSTGRES_URL` points at a disposable PostgreSQL 16 or 17
database, for example:

```sh
docker run --rm -d --name orca-relay-pg -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=orca_relay_test -p 55440:5432 postgres:16-alpine
ORCA_RELAY_TEST_POSTGRES_URL=postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:55440/orca_relay_test \
  pnpm --filter @orca-cloud/relay test
docker rm -f orca-relay-pg
```

Configuration is read from environment variables validated in
`apps/relay/src/config.ts`. `ORCA_RELAY_ASSIGNMENT_SIGNING_KEY` (at least 32
bytes) is the only required value; everything else has a local default.
