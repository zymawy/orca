# Failure modes

Load this when a doctor, provision, clone, login, or snapshot step failed. Each entry maps a
symptom to its cause; the rule that prevents it lives in the guide next to the step.

## Reading a failed `--provision` result

The JSON result carries a `provisionTranscript` with each stage's captured output, so you can
diagnose without asking the user for logs:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "checks": [{ "id": "recipe.provision", "status": "fail", "message": "…" }],
  "provisionTranscript": {
    "provision": { "exitCode": 0, "signal": null, "stdout": "…", "stderr": "…", "parseError": "…" },
    "destroy": { "exitCode": 0, "signal": null, "stdout": "…", "stderr": "…" }
  }
}
```

Streams are redacted and capped at both ends, keeping the start and the failure. Two common reads:

- A non-empty `stderr` with `exitCode 0` plus a `parseError` means `create` ran but printed something
  other than the single recipe-result JSON object on stdout. The offending stdout is in the
  transcript; the usual cause is a stray `echo`.
- A non-zero `exitCode` is a provider or script failure, described in `stderr`.

## Build and clone

- **Build exceeds the plan timeout**, for example Vercel Hobby's 45 minutes. Use enough vCPUs and a
  timeout that covers the build, or split the work, or move to a higher plan. The same cap limits
  per-workspace runtime, so surface it to the user.
- **Build exceeds plan RAM.** Building the headless main only, dropping the renderer, is the single
  biggest fit.
- **Private-repo clone hangs or fails.** The token is wrong or missing. `GIT_ASKPASS` plus
  `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` makes it fail fast instead of prompting.
- **The `GIT_ASKPASS` helper aborts the clone with `$1: unbound variable`.** The `printf` or heredoc
  that wrote the helper inside `bash -lc` under `set -u` expanded `$1` and `$GH_TOKEN` at write time
  instead of leaving them for git-runtime. The same mistake writes the real token into the file.

## Agent auth

- **The agent verifies as "not logged in" despite a good login.** `codex login status` and similar
  print their success line to stderr, so a check that reads stdout only misses it.
- **A headless agent login hangs.** Plain OAuth `login` started a loopback callback server on a port
  the host browser cannot reach.
- **Agent auth did not persist.** Confirm `snapshotId` points at the authenticated snapshot rather
  than the base, and re-run the auth phase. If the agent's credentials are short-lived, the snapshot
  needs periodic re-auth; warn the user.
- **Agent auth copied from the host breaks.** A bind-mounted or copied host agent home carries sqlite
  files that can be unwritable or host-specific, hooks that need approval again, and config that
  references local-only environment variables. Authenticate inside the runtime and snapshot or commit
  that layer instead.

## Environment lifecycle

- **`known_hosts` mismatch on local Docker.** A new container may reuse an old container's port.
  Read its public key through trusted local Docker access, verify the container identity, then
  replace only that endpoint's recorded key. Never reuse private host keys across workspace images.
- **Snapshot expired or evicted.** `create` hit an unknown snapshot id. Re-run the base and auth
  snapshot phases and update `snapshotId` in state.
- **Docker auth image exits immediately.** Read `docker image inspect … .Config.Entrypoint` and
  `docker logs`. An image committed from an interactive shell keeps that shell as its entrypoint.
- **A paid resource leaked.** A long script created an environment and then failed without a trap
  that removes it.
