# SSH Execution Boundary

How Orca splits work between your machine and an SSH host, what survives a disconnect, and how to keep `unverifiable` distinct from `exited`. Nothing under `docs/` stated this before; agents and humans were inferring it from error strings and getting it wrong.

## The rule

**The execution host owns everything that touches execution** — tools, credentials, identity, environment, processes, and artifacts. The client owns the UI, transport, and Orca control-plane state, but is not authoritative for execution state.

Two consequences, both non-negotiable:

1. **No silent substitution.** An operation on a remote `repoPath` must never fall back to running on the client. A missing SSH provider is not permission to answer locally — a local run can answer for the _wrong repository_.
2. **No asserting what you cannot observe.** Loss of contact is not evidence of `exited`. Report `unverifiable`, never `exited`.

The vocabulary is fixed: **`live` / `unverifiable` / `exited`**, taken from the incumbent `UnstoppedPtyVerdict`. Do not introduce synonyms, and never collapse `unverifiable` into either neighbour. `exited` requires positive evidence of absence from the host that owns the process; a transport failure can only ever produce `unverifiable`.

Rule 1 is stated at `src/main/source-control/repo-default-branch.ts:76-78`, `src/main/repo-worktrees.ts:45-48`, `OrcaRuntimeService.probeWorktreeDrift` in `src/main/runtime/orca-runtime.ts`, and `src/renderer/src/lib/connection-context.ts:22-24`. It is enforced throughout `src/main/runtime/orca-runtime-git.ts` by `requireRuntimeGitProvider` in `src/main/runtime/runtime-git-command-target.ts`, and throughout the runtime filesystem commands by `requireRuntimeFileProvider` in `src/main/runtime/runtime-file-command-target.ts`. Both route on the target's resolved `executionHostId` rather than on a repo row's `connectionId`: they throw the provider-unavailable message when an SSH host has no registered provider, throw `ExecutionHostNotDispatchableError` for a `runtime:` host this process does not execute, and return `null` only for `local`. Grep those names for the current call sites rather than trusting a count.

`src/main/runtime/unstopped-pty-verification.ts:12-16` is the reference implementation of rule 2: it keeps `live` / `unverifiable` / `exited` as three distinct verdicts, and treats "we could not ask" as its own answer.

## Survival: what a disconnect does _not_ do

By default, remote work survives your machine going away. The relay is a detached daemon (`nohup … </dev/null &`), its handler in `src/relay/relay.ts` ignores `SIGHUP`, the PTY is its child rather than the ssh channel's, and quitting Orca is a **detach, not a dispose** (`src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-session.ts:901-915`). Sleep additionally pushes `graceTimeSeconds: 0` to un-bound any running grace window.

Two ways remote work _can_ actually stop:

- **A bounded grace period.** The shipped default is `0` = keep alive until reset. If "keep terminals alive until reset" is unchecked, the configurable range is **60s–7d** and the form defaults to **24h**. The countdown starts when the client disconnects, after which the relay SIGKILLs every PTY. Note the asymmetry: sleep protects you, but ordinary disconnect and app quit do not. No command reports which setting is in effect for a target, so at N hours since disconnect you cannot tell "unlimited" from "24h with 7 left" — treat the remote as `unverifiable`, not `exited`.
- **Host-acknowledged explicit user action** — End Remote Terminals, Reset Relay, removing the target, or closing the tab. When the host cannot acknowledge the request, closing a tab or removing a target may clear only client state; the remote verdict remains `unverifiable`.

Reconnect re-attaches to the same live PTYs and replays a bounded buffer (`REPLAY_BUFFER_MAX`, a 102,400-code-unit tail). Output beyond that while you were away is lost to the client even though the process was never interrupted: **the transcript is truncated; the work stays `live`.**

## Updating Orca strands relay-backed terminals

There is a third outcome that is neither of the two above, and the vocabulary matters: the work does not stop, it becomes permanently unreachable.

The relay's install directory — and therefore its socket path — is namespaced by a content hash of the relay bundle (`computeRemoteRelayDir` in `src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-versioned-install.ts`, consumed by `resolveRemoteInstallState` in `src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-deploy.ts`), and the daemon refuses any client whose bundle hash differs (`handleDaemonHandshakeFrame` in `src/relay/relay-handshake.ts`, exit `EXIT_CODE_VERSION_MISMATCH` 42). Two builds whose relay protocol is byte-identical still refuse each other. So the first reconnect after an app update deploys a new relay at a path the incumbent was never listening on, and cannot reach it even in principle. Every PTY the incumbent owns is `unverifiable` — running, unreachable, and never `exited`. The client's leases are attempted against a relay that never minted their ids, expired on the not-found answer (`handlePtyReattachFailure` in `src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-session.ts`), and the pane falls back to a cold-restore agent resume — or to a bare shell when no resumable provider session was captured for it. The old relay keeps its directory pinned against GC, because its socket really is live (`hasLiveRelaySocket` in `src/main/ssh/remote-install-gc.ts`). See #13852.

The peer model does not have this failure, and that is the concrete reason behind "One host, one model" below. The daemon's endpoint is namespaced by a **semantic protocol version** rather than a build (`daemon-v<N>.sock`, from `getDaemonSocketPath` in `src/main/daemon/daemon-spawner.ts`), every earlier protocol version stays attachable (`PROTOCOL_VERSION` in `src/main/daemon/daemon-protocol-version.ts`), and a daemon holding live sessions is preserved across a version change instead of replaced (`shouldPreserveDaemonWithLiveSessions` in `src/main/daemon/daemon-replacement-preflight.ts`).

## Control plane

On an SSH host, `orca` is a shim (`~/.orca-relay/bin/orca`) that proxies **back to the client's runtime** over the relay socket. Your repository, processes, and files remain remote — only the control plane is on the client. This is correct for an SSH target, but it has a consequence worth stating plainly:

> When the client disconnects, every `orca …` command run on the SSH host fails with `No owning Orca client is connected to the relay`. The PTY stays `live`; its control plane does not.

Orchestration state (Runs, Tasks, Dispatches, mailboxes) is client-resident for the same reason. An agent on an SSH host should not depend on `orca` for anything it must finish while you are away. **Commit and push early** — unpushed work on a remote box is unavailable to the client until it reconnects.

## Distinguishing `unverifiable` from `exited`

A verdict needs evidence from the host that owns the process. Apply these tests in order.

**Was the signal produced by the owning host, or by the client's own bookkeeping?** Absence from a client-side set, a lookup that threw, a socket that closed, a command that timed out — none of these observe the process. They are `unverifiable` by construction, whatever the field is named.

**Did every remote PTY on that target go quiet at once?** A transport drop takes them all together. Simultaneous silence across a host indicates a lost link, not simultaneous death.

**Does the termination event match the current identity?** A host-delivered exit for the live PTY incarnation and provider generation, while its siblings still report, establishes `exited`. A stale event, an event for a superseded incarnation, or one quiet terminal with no host evidence does not.

**Did the answer carry its evidence, or only the same wording?** `pty.attach` refuses with `PTY "<id>" not found` both for a pid the relay probed and found gone and for an id its session map never had — which is every id minted before a relay restart, since ids carry a per-start mint epoch. Only the probed refusal carries `PTY_ATTACH_PROVEN_EXITED_MARKER` (`src/shared/pty-attach-absence-evidence.ts`) and reaches the client as `SshPtyProvenExitedOnRelayError`; the unmarked union arrives as `SshPtyAbsentFromRelayError`, which licenses retiring the client's own route to the PTY and nothing more. A missing marker is never evidence — an older relay omits it too.

**Is a returned status actually a claim of success?** An operation that reports failure may have succeeded, and one that reports success may not have run — check the durable state it should have changed rather than trusting the return.

Anything short of positive host evidence is `unverifiable`. Reporting it as `exited` is the error this document exists to prevent: it orphans live work and can cold-start a duplicate over the same worktree.

## Host contact is a different question from process liveness

The `live` / `unverifiable` / `exited` triple above answers one question: is this PTY running. It has
no synonyms, and nothing below adds any.

A second, narrower question — can we currently reach the host at all, and what is its last answer
worth — is answered by `RuntimeHostContact` (`src/shared/runtime-host-contact.ts`), whose arms are
`live` / `unverifiable` / `refused` / `retired`. These are **not** extra process verdicts and must
never be mapped onto one:

- `refused` is the host answering and turning us away — unauthorized, a protocol mismatch, a status
  method it does not implement. That is positive evidence about the _connection_, and it says
  nothing whatever about whether the host's PTYs are running. They almost certainly still are.
- `retired` is the pairing being ended by explicit user action. Same point: the client stops having
  a route, the remote work is unaffected.

Both are reasons to stop _trusting a cached answer_, never reasons to report a process `exited`. A
reader that needs a process verdict must still get it from the host that owns the process, by the
tests above.

Why the extra arms exist at all: the renderer previously expressed every non-answer as one nullable
`status`, so a probe in flight, a probe that failed, a host that refused us and a retired pairing
all reached readers as the same `null` — and readers spent that `null` on decisions of very
different weight, including destructive ones. Folding `refused` and `retired` back into
`unverifiable` to match this document's triple would recreate exactly that collapse. The vocabularies
are deliberately separate because the questions are.

## Deciding a remote pane is idle

The orphan-PTY sweep is the one flow that turns an observation into a SIGKILL, so its idleness evidence has to be measured against the same thing the signal reaches. It is not the terminal.

`forceKillPosixPtyProcessGroups` (`src/main/pty/posix-pty-process-groups.ts`) collects every process group on the pane's tty and `killpg`s each one. The blast radius is therefore _(process groups on the tty) × (members of those groups, wherever they are)_, and the second factor is not bounded by the terminal at all. Two facts make that gap reachable:

- **Job control can be off.** With `set +m` a background job does not get its own process group — it keeps the shell's. `ps` then shows one process group on the tty, running a build. Nothing in a tty-shaped predicate can see it.
- **A group member can leave the terminal.** `ioctl(TIOCNOTTY)` without `setsid` drops the controlling terminal but keeps the pgid, so the process reports `tpgid == -1`, never appears in `ps -t <tty>`, and is still killed by `killpg(shellPgid)`. A double-forked grandchild similarly keeps the pgid while reparenting to pid 1, so no walk by `ppid` from the PTY root can name it either.

So `shellOwnsEveryTtyProcessGroup` (`src/main/providers/agent-foreground-process-batch.ts`) requires both measurements: every process group on the tty is the shell's own with none stopped, **and** the shell's own process group has no other member anywhere in the host's process table. The name is tty-shaped for wire-compatibility reasons only.

Two residuals remain, and neither is removable here. The capture is a snapshot, so work started between the `ps` and the signal is invisible — bounded by `RELAY_PTY_SWEEP_MAX_EVIDENCE_AGE_MS` on the reading side, not eliminated. And a process the host's own `ps` cannot enumerate (another PID namespace, `hidepid=2`, a table truncated by a permission boundary) is unobservable while `killpg` still reaches it.

The general rule this instantiates: **evidence must be measured in the unit the destructive action operates on.** Evidence in a different unit is `unverifiable` no matter how precise it looks.

## Reading artifacts instead of process state

Artifacts are stronger evidence than liveness signals, but they answer a narrower question than they appear to.

A matching commit from `git ls-remote --heads origin <branch>` or a PR head lookup proves **that commit reached the remote** — not that the current run pushed it, and not that the latest work was included. An absent result proves nothing was found, not that nothing was pushed: the ref may have been deleted, the PR closed, or the query may simply have failed.

A listing is only evidence about the hosts it actually covered. When a result does not name its scope, an empty answer is not evidence that nothing is running elsewhere. A clean **local** worktree says nothing at all about the remote one.

## One host, one model

An SSH host and a paired runtime (`orca environment`) imply opposite boundaries: the first is a dumb execution host driven by your client, the second is a peer that owns its own control plane. Registering the same machine both ways splits its worktrees across two identities, makes `terminal list` return different sets depending on `--environment`, and reliably confuses both humans and agents. Pick one per machine.

For work that must continue while you are offline, use the peer/headless-runtime model on the remote host instead of the direct-SSH model. Its control plane is host-local, and its daemon-backed PTYs can stay `live` across a PID-scoped runtime restart so the runtime can reattach. A service manager that reaps the runtime's cgroup, or an explicit daemon shutdown, makes them `exited`; see [Running orcad](./orcad-operations.md#process-scoped-and-cgroup-wide-stops). Do not register the same machine through both models. A detached agent process outside Orca can also survive a control-plane outage, but it has no stdin, so its instructions cannot be amended mid-run.
