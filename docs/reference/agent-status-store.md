# Agent status store

## Status

The current boundary is PR 2A: structured sessions use the hook server's fully
scoped canonical store; unbound PTY/relay evidence remains in an isolated legacy
adapter. Do not remove the renderer bridge or its publication filters in this
slice: they still carry native-chat child rows.

The sections below record the original 2026-09-09 rollout. Its PR 1a and PR 1b
have landed; its proposed PR 2/3 sequence is superseded by that boundary:

1. main-only: every producer writes into one store and `worktree ps` reads it,
   split into 1a (structured sessions join the store) and 1b (the runtime's
   duplicate retained store is deleted);
2. renderer: the sidebar becomes a subscriber and stops re-deriving rows;
3. shared: one worktree-status rollup and one freshness rule for every reader.

## The problem this solves

Orca shows "what is this agent doing" in four places: the desktop sidebar, the
`orca worktree ps` command, the mobile app, and the agent dashboard. Before
#19217 those readers did not even share their inputs. After #19217 they share
the structured-session mapping and nothing else.

An audit on 2026-09-09 found six producers and three consumers, and three
separate copies of the same row inside the main process alone:

| Main-process copy                 | Keyed by  | Owned by                                                                          | Persisted          | Evicted                      |
| --------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| hook server `lastStatusByPaneKey` | paneKey   | `src/main/agent-hooks/server.ts`                                                  | `last-status.json` | tab close, pty exit, hydrate |
| runtime `RuntimeAgentRowStore`    | paneKey   | `runtime-agent-row-store.ts` (deleted in PR 1b)                                   | no                 | pty exit only                |
| structured feed `published`       | sessionId | `src/main/native-chat/agent-session-wire/structured-agent-session-status-feed.ts` | no                 | never (a broadcast cache)    |

The second copy is a duplicate write: the OSC status parsed in main is
forwarded to the hook server _and_ retained in the runtime store from the same
call (`orca-runtime-create-terminal-side-effect-command-code-detector.ts`).
The third copy is keyed differently and never reaches the hook server at all,
which is why `worktree ps` grew its own adapter for it in #19217.

Each reader then applies its own precedence and freshness rules, so the same
pane can legitimately read differently on the desktop, on the phone, and in
the CLI.

## The rule

**The execution host owns agent status, in one store, and every reader
subscribes to it.** This follows the boundary in
[`ssh-execution-boundary.md`](./ssh-execution-boundary.md): the host that runs
the process is the only party that can observe it, and the client is never
authoritative for execution state.

Three consequences:

- One store per execution host. A remote host keeps its own store and the
  client mirrors it down, as the web-session mirror already does. Mirroring is
  not merging: a client never writes its observations back to a host.
- Precedence is decided once, at write time, with provenance recorded on the
  row. Readers never re-adjudicate hook versus terminal versus structured.
- Readers keep only presentation policy and user facts: the 30-minute display
  decay, acknowledgements, dismissals, unread. Those stay reader-side but
  become one shared implementation (PR 3).

## The store already exists

The hook server's state is that store today for every PTY-based agent. The
audit established:

- hook HTTP posts, the WSL and SSH relay receivers, and main's own OSC parse
  all converge on the same `applyNormalizedStatus` path, stamped with the
  authority id `main-agent-hooks`;
- it alone holds pane authority: launch tokens and their hashed commitments,
  retired-pane fences, pane-key aliases, per-connection ordering watermarks,
  and the evidence-age map that must outlive a transport clear;
- it alone persists, with a seven-day hydrate window and the
  `restoredUnconfirmed` stamp that keeps a hydrated row from ever reading as
  live truth;
- it already fans out to both renderer windows over `agentStatus:set` and
  `agentStatus:clear`, and serves `agentStatus:getSnapshot`.

Nothing else in main carries those guarantees, and building a second store
with them would be the wrong direction. So the design is not "add a store". It
is: **route the two producers that bypass the hook server through it, then
delete the copies.**

## PR 1a: structured sessions publish into the store

No renderer behavior changes. The sidebar keeps receiving the same IPC events
it receives today, plus structured-session rows it currently derives itself.

### Structured sessions publish into the hook server

The structured feed keeps its job of projecting a session's journal into a
summary and streaming it to subscribers. On every publish it additionally
ingests the summary into the hook server as a status row:

| Row field                                           | From                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `paneKey`                                           | `structuredAgentSessionPaneKey(tabId, sessionId)`, the key the renderer already uses; its leaf is UUID-shaped so pane-key validation accepts it                               |
| `tabId`                                             | `structuredAgentSessionTabId(sessionId)`                                                                                                                                      |
| `worktreeId`                                        | `summary.workspaceId` (a folder workspace id is a valid value)                                                                                                                |
| `state`                                             | `structuredAgentSessionAgentStatus(summary).state`: the lead's own status folded with its live `backgroundTasks`, so a settled lead whose subagent still runs reads `working` |
| `workingMode`                                       | `'monitoring'` from the same fold when watch loops are the only live child work; omitted otherwise, which clears it on the row                                                |
| `mainAgent`                                         | the main agent's own state before the fold, its last-turn verdict (`summary.turnOutcome`, present only while idle) and its own clock; see "The main agent fact" below         |
| `structuredHost`                                    | `'owned'` while `summary.hostExecutionOwned` is set, otherwise `'held'`; `worktree ps` derives its row's `structuredHostOwned` from it                                        |
| prompt, tool, last message, model, provider session | the summary's fields                                                                                                                                                          |

Sessions with no request (`status === null`) produce no row. A request is a
turn record, an assistant message, a user message the provider journaled itself
(history, an older host), an accepted or unanswered send, or a send the agent or
its start refused; a send that was withdrawn, or left undelivered by a
restart or a close, fails nobody and makes nothing listable.
`summary.turnOutcome` is the latest request's verdict: its turn's outcome, or
`failure` for a send the agent or its start refused (a send that joined a running
turn is answered by that turn). The row also publishes `interrupted` from
`mainAgent.outcome`, exactly as the hook lanes do. When the host revokes live ownership the row is re-set
without the flag; when the host closes or evicts the session the row is
dropped. Both already exist as feed events (`revokeLive` and the roster
filter in `liveSessionSummaries`); PR 1 turns them into store writes.

Dropping the session from the host's map and dropping its row are one
operation, `forgetStructuredAgentSession`. The store keeps a row until told,
and a host-owned row bypasses the staleness check, so a deletion path that
forgot the row would strand a permanently working-looking agent.

Two rules the ingest must keep:

- **Never persist a structured row.** The journal is the durable truth for a
  structured session and the host republishes on restore. A structured row in
  `last-status.json` would hydrate as `restoredUnconfirmed` and then fight the
  live republish. The serializer skips rows carrying `structuredHost`, and
  hydrate drops any such row found on disk. Applying one therefore also skips
  the persist schedule: the walk and stringify could only reproduce the file
  that is already on disk, once per debounce window for every streaming chat.
- **Never let it fight a hook row.** A structured session has no PTY, so no
  hook or OSC event carries its pane key. The ingest still goes through the
  disposition gate so a retired pane key is refused like any other.

Applying one does still run both status fan-outs, and that is intended rather
than incidental. `notifyStatusChangeListeners` is what feeds
`agentAwakeService`'s power-save blocker, and `subscribeEnrichedStatus` is what
feeds `AgentSessionTransitionRecorder`'s stats, so joining the store enrolls
native chats in both. A working native chat is real work and should hold the
machine awake exactly like a PTY agent does.

The drop side routes through `dropStatusEntry`, not `clearPaneState`: a
pane-status-clear reaches the renderer, and until PR 2 the renderer's own feed
bridge is that pane key's writer. It also passes `preserveResumeIdentity:
false` — the `providerSessionOnly` remnant a dismissed pane keeps exists so the
agent can be resumed in that pane, and a structured session has no pane and
keeps its resume identity in the record store. Like every other
`dropStatusEntry` caller, it emits no pane clear, so a session dropped
mid-`working` leaves `AgentSessionTransitionRecorder` holding an open stats
session until its LRU evicts it; that gap is shared with the user-dismissal
path and is not specific to structured rows.

The ingest lives in the feed, not in `structured-agent-session-host.ts`, which
sits at the file-length cap.

### `worktree ps` becomes a reader

The structured adapter added in #19217 is deleted, and structured rows reach
`worktree ps` through the same snapshot as every other row. The
retained-versus-hook reconciliation in `collectRuntimeWorktreePtyAgentSources`
stayed until PR 1b removed the store that fed it. What this step settles is
the admission gate that decides which rows a worktree listing may show:

- a hook or OSC row needs its tab mirrored or a connected pty, as today, and
  SSH rows stay exempt because their tabs may exist only remotely;
- a row carrying `structuredHost` is admitted while the host holds the session, and
  the host's drop on close is what removes it. No tab-mirror requirement: a
  structured session's tab lives in the renderer's own tab state, and a
  headless host has no renderer to mirror it from. That argument only holds if
  the headless host is itself wired to the store, which is a separate
  obligation per entry point: the Electron hosts (desktop and `orca serve`)
  share `main-process-runtime-service.ts`, and `orcad` constructs its own
  runtime in `src/main/orcad/orcad-entry.ts`. A host missing that wiring lists
  no agents at all, not just no structured ones, because `worktree ps` reads
  the same snapshot for every row.

The freshness bypass for host-owned structured rows already exists in
`isFreshNonDoneAgentStatus`; with the flag now on the row it becomes the only
path, and the hand-rolled check in `runtime-worktree-agent-rows.ts` goes.

### Wire compatibility

`AgentStatusIpcPayload` gains one optional field, `structuredHost`, and the
`worktree ps` row gains `structuredHostOwned`. Under rule 1 of
[`remote-wire-compatibility.md`](./remote-wire-compatibility.md) both are safe:
an old client ignores them. `worktree ps` rows keep their shape and vocabulary,
so the mobile app sees no change.

Until PR 2 the main process does not forward structured rows to the renderer
over `agentStatus:set` or `agentStatus:getSnapshot`. The renderer's feed
bridge still writes those rows itself, and forwarding them too would give one
pane key two writers. Removing that filter is the first step of PR 2.

### The main agent fact

Claude, Codex and Grok hook rows and structured-session rows publish the combined
`state` and, beside it, the main agent's own state as `payload.mainAgent`. Other agents'
rows and terminal-title-only rows carry none, and readers fall back to `state`:

```ts
mainAgent?: { state: AgentStatusState; outcome?: AgentJournalTurnOutcome; stateStartedAt: number }
```

`state` still answers "what should the user see" and folds live child work in,
so a settled main agent whose subagent still runs reads `working`. `mainAgent` answers
"what is the main agent itself doing", which the fold used to destroy at publish
time; every guard that reconstructed a fragment of it (`fromChildWork`, the
persisted `claudeLeadBoundaryChildOnly` flag) now reads `mainAgent` instead of a
stored copy. A Claude row whose `mainAgent` is `done` while a child agent still
works (including a child's permission wait) refuses OSC, which carries no child
identity; the children's own lifecycle hooks settle it. `outcome` is the recorded verdict on
the main agent's most recent finished turn, present only while `mainAgent.state` is
`done`. It is reported by the provider, or is a `cancellation` Orca inferred
from the user's own interrupt keystroke (the journal's turn outcome, by
contrast, is never inferred). A plain end of turn carries none, because absent
means unknown and a provider that omits its interrupt flag must not turn a
cancel into a success.
In the Claude hook lane the cancellation comes primarily from Orca's own
inferred interrupt (`markClaudeLeadTurnInterrupted`), because current Claude
sends no hook at all on a cancel and no `is_interrupt` on Stop; that flag on a
turn boundary remains a secondary source for builds that send it, and
`StopFailure` maps to `failure`.

Readers decode the verdict through one accessor, `agentMainAgentVerdict`, which
reads the main agent's own state, not the combined row's: `mainAgent.outcome`
while `mainAgent.state` is `done`, then the legacy `interrupted` flag as a
cancellation, which alone needs the combined `done`. So a main agent that
failed while its subagents still run has a verdict on a `working` row. Every
copy of a row (state-history entries, sleep records, `worktree ps` rows) takes
the verdict through `agentVerdictFields`, which carries `interrupted` and the
whole `mainAgent` (state, outcome and its own clock) together, so a copy agrees
with the row and can date a failure by `mainAgent.stateStartedAt`.

Display reads the verdict through `agentVerdictDisplayMark`: a failure marks the
agent failed whatever the combined state, because it is news the user must see
even while subagents run; a stop marks it interrupted only on a `done` row, so
a stopped or finished main agent with live child work still reads working.
Each subagent keeps its own row and state. Container rollups (worktree card,
terminal tab, Cmd+J) rank a pending question first, then a failure, then live
work, then a stop, then done. On the worktree card, a failure retained after its
agent's pane went away has no expiry, so it ranks below live work and above a
stop. Lifecycle waiters keep reading the combined `state`.

Policy splits the verdict two ways. Clean-finish policy (hibernation, pane
ownership, the star-nag value moment) treats a failure like a cancellation
(`agentTurnEndedUncleanly`). Attention (completion time, Smart Sort, sticky
retention, Cmd+J Recent) demotes only a turn the user stopped
(`agentTurnStoppedByUser`); a failure ranks like a completion.

Admission is one function, `normalizeAgentStatusPayload`, on the relay wire,
IPC and disk. A malformed `mainAgent` drops the field and keeps the row. Old hosts
send none and readers fall back to `state`. Hook rows persist it inside the
payload; hydration maps an older row's `claudeLeadBoundaryChildOnly: true`
onto `mainAgent: { state: 'done' }` when the row has no `mainAgent`, and never writes the
flag again. Hydration seeds the Claude main agent record straight from a saved
`mainAgent` that is `done`, so the children's drain can still settle the row after
a restart. `claudeRunningNonAgentTask` is persisted alongside because it is the one
child-work fact `mainAgent` cannot express: a shell running beside the main agent,
whose liveness hydration does not restore. Hydration seeds only a row that says
`false`; a row silent about it stays unseeded. The row builder pairs the two facts in
one place: a listener event restates the shell fact, and any other write (an OSC
repaint, an inferred answer) keeps it only while `mainAgent` is unchanged. A child's
sticky permission prompt still records the main agent's own progress and background
evidence in the held row, and pushes the held row to subscribers when `mainAgent` changes.

Every lane, Codex included, combines through the fold. A child waiting on a
human is a fold input (`childWorkLiveness: 'waiting'`, derived from the child's
own `waiting` state; a child's `blocked` means it failed and stays live work)
and makes the row wait whatever the main agent is doing, unless the main agent
is itself asking. Only the Codex hook lane feeds that input today. Known
divergences, pinned by name in the parity table
(`src/shared/main-agent-status-parity.test.ts`) where they are reachable, so a
reader does not mistake them for drift:

- The Claude hook lane holds a child's permission wait in one slot on the
  displaced main agent record (`waitingAgentId`, `stateBeforeWait`), not on
  the child. It publishes the displaced state as `mainAgent`, but the next
  main agent event overwrites the slot, so the row stops reading `waiting`
  while the child is still asking, and a second asking child replaces the
  first.
- The structured lane has no per-child wait: a child's pending prompt makes
  the session `attention`, which reads as the main agent's own `blocked`.
- The Codex hook lane drops its roster on a root `Stop` when it tracks no
  child transcripts, so a still-running or still-asking child stops holding
  the row.

How the main agent's turn ended is not a fold input. A cancel is a verdict on
the main agent, carried as `mainAgent.outcome: 'cancellation'` (and, for
readers that predate `mainAgent`, as the row's `interrupted` flag on a `done`
row); it never retires a shell, scheduled check or subagent the turn left
running. That work leaves the row only when its own inventory omits it or the
session ends, so a cancelled turn with a still-running shell reads
`monitoring` in every lane, and the parity table in
`src/shared/main-agent-status-parity.test.ts` drives that story through all of
them. The same rule governs the cancel Orca infers from Ctrl+C: for any row
that publishes `mainAgent`, the inference is admitted only when
`mainAgent.state` is `working`, so Orca does not treat a Ctrl+C at the idle
prompt of a row held open by child work as a turn cancel (Codex also keeps the
child-evidence guard, and a row without `mainAgent` keeps only that guard).
The keypress itself is not inert, though: measured live, Claude 2.1.280 stops
its background subagents on a single idle-prompt Ctrl+C (shells survive) and
Codex 0.156.1 quits outright, so refusing the inference can leave the row
showing a subagent its CLI already stopped. The synthesized row is the fold
of the cancelled main agent with the child work the pane's owner can see: the
local listener's roster for a local pane, the row's own subagents and shell fact
for a relayed one, whose provider records live on the relay.

The store holds that verdict against restatements that predate it
(`server-cancel-verdict-latch.ts`), because a relay never learns of a cancel
the desktop infers and some TUIs emit late same-turn hooks. The hold is read
off the row (`mainAgent.outcome: 'cancellation'`), never stored beside it, and
dies on a new turn (a main agent prompt submission, a changed or explicit
prompt, a session start) or the provider's own settled `mainAgent`. Child and
replayed events under the hold keep the cancelled main agent and are re-folded
with their own child evidence.

## PR 1b: the runtime's retained row store is deleted

Landed. `RuntimeAgentRowStore` is gone, and with it the retained-versus-hook
reconciliation in `collectRuntimeWorktreePtyAgentSources`. The hook server's
store is now the only main-process copy of a PTY agent's row.

Both readers moved into `runtime-hook-agent-row-selection.ts`, which also owns
`RuntimeAgentRowSnapshot` now that nothing retains one.

### `terminalHandle` is the row's join back to its terminal

The retained store's only real extra was the pty id, and two readers used it.
The plan said to stamp the event's `ptyId` into `terminalHandle`; that was
wrong. A terminal handle (`term_<uuid>`) and a pty id are different
identifiers, and `getFreshExplicit` was already comparing hook rows against a
real handle. What landed instead:

- `AgentHookEventPayload` and the runtime's terminal-status event gained an
  optional `terminalHandle`. The detector resolves it once per chunk through
  `getAgentStatusTerminalHandleForPaneKey` — the same lookup the renderer-facing
  IPC boundary already runs for every row, so the two surfaces cannot disagree
  about which terminal a pane is.
- `applyNormalizedStatus` carries the handle forward when an incoming event
  resolves none. Only main's OSC parse can resolve one, so an HTTP hook post for
  the same pane would otherwise erase it.
- It is never persisted. A handle belongs to the runtime that issued it, and a
  hydrated one could only rejoin a row to somebody else's terminal.
- `toAgentStatusIpcPayload` publishes it, which also makes `getFreshExplicit`'s
  long-dead handle comparison live: the runtime reads raw snapshot rows, and
  before this nothing ever stamped the field on them.

`worktree ps` uses it too. `ConnectedPtyEvidence` traded its flat `ptyIds` set
for `ptyIdByTerminalHandle`, so a row still resolves the connected PTY behind
it — which is both the working-terminal rollup's match key and the last rescue
for a row whose pane binding was nulled by a controller incarnation change.

### The change detector had to move with the store

`retain()` was not only a store: its boolean return was the signal that
republished `session.tabs` for a status-only transition, which no title change
covers (#7970). `hook-status-session-tabs-invalidation.ts` already mirrors that
projection change set, including restore provenance and terminal-handle joins,
so the replacement was to route the signal off the store rather than build a
second comparator.
`installHookStatusSessionTabsRepublish` now owns all three arms — enriched
status, pane clear, and the status-drop tap a dismissal emits — and both hosts
install it.

### Both hosts, not just the desktop one

`orcad` constructed its runtime with no `onTerminalAgentStatus`, so main's OSC
parse never reached the store there and the retained copy was the only carrier.
Deleting it without wiring orcad would have made a headless host list no PTY
agents at all. `orcad-entry.ts` now binds the producer and installs the
republish signal, alongside the snapshot and structured sink it already had.

### The intended behavior change

A row the user dismisses on the desktop leaves `worktree ps` and the phone at
once, instead of lingering until the pty exits. One store means one dismissal.

Legacy numeric pane keys remain a bounded compatibility case. Persisted layouts
register aliases to their stable leaf owners; an in-process OSC observation may
also retain a numeric key only when the runtime supplies the matching tab, PTY,
and terminal handle. HTTP and relay ingress still require a stable key or a
registered alias, and numeric rows are never persisted.

## PR 2: the renderer subscribes

With structured rows arriving over `agentStatus:set`, the renderer's
`StructuredAgentSessionStatusBridge` no longer needs to write status; its
unmount cleanup becomes a tab-close signal to the host. The IPC applicator is
the single writer for observed status. The 2026-09-09 audit sorted the other
writers:

| Writer                                                            | Disposition                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Command Code output seeds, parked-pane seeds, pty-exit removal    | delete; main already emits the same facts                                                                |
| structured bridge status writes                                   | delete; main now publishes the row                                                                       |
| launch placeholder seeds (a user launched an agent with a prompt) | keep for now; main holds the launch config and can seed later                                            |
| dismissal, acknowledgement, unmount                               | keep; user facts and component lifecycle                                                                 |
| remote-runtime OSC parse (bytes never transit local main)         | keep, fenced behind the host's published row once the host is new enough; rule 3 of the wire doc applies |
| web-session mirror receipt clock                                  | keep; the decay rule needs both clocks from one machine                                                  |

The Command Code done-settle window is renderer policy with no main
equivalent. PR 2 either moves it into main's detector or leaves it, and says
which.

## PR 3: one rollup, one clock

The worktree card status is derived three times: `lib/worktree-status.ts` in
the renderer, `runtime-worktree-status-projection.ts` in main, and
`agent-row-display.ts` in mobile, which hand-copies the 30-minute constant.
PR 3 moves the rollup and the decay into `src/shared` and makes all three
call it.

## What does not change

- The hook scripts, the OSC 9999 wire format, and the relay protocol.
- The status vocabulary. `working / blocked / done` for rows,
  `working / attention / idle` for structured summaries, mapped once.
- The `live / unverifiable / exited` verdicts for remote work. Loss of contact
  clears nothing; the SSH exemptions in the admission gate stay.
- Hydration honesty: a restored non-done row is `restoredUnconfirmed` and is
  never fresh.

## PR 1b reliability contract

- **Invariant (`agent-session.status-host-ownership`):** each execution host has
  one agent-status store; OSC, hooks, and structured sessions write it, while
  desktop, `worktree ps`, and mobile only project it. Dismissal, certified PTY
  exit, and provider-generation replacement remove the same row everywhere;
  transport loss alone removes nothing.
- **Failure source:** the deleted runtime row store duplicated OSC observations,
  keyed them by a different terminal identity, and outlived a dismissal from the
  hook store. Relay replay could also make old evidence look fresh when readers
  used its new delivery timestamp.
- **Oracle:** one OSC observation appears through the hook snapshot in
  `worktree ps` and mobile, and one store dismissal removes it from both without
  stopping the PTY. Focused tests also require leaf/incarnation-handle rejoin,
  legacy numeric-pane compatibility, certified-exit and provider-generation
  cleanup, evidence-age freshness, and exactly-once startup/stop teardown.
- **Gate:** `terminal-performance.osc-status-scan-budget` covers the unchanged
  bounded OSC parser and the runtime projection. There is not yet a dedicated
  blocking multi-surface status-store gate; the focused suites below are the
  accepted gap until they accumulate reliability-gate soak evidence.
- **Provider/platform coverage:** local and daemon-backed PTYs are covered by
  runtime tests, and SSH relay loss/replay semantics by relay integration tests.
  The projection is shared by git worktrees and folder workspaces. WSL uses the
  same store and admission code but has no live run here; Linux and Windows
  runtime execution, native mobile clients, and mixed-version paired clients
  remain validation gaps.
- **Performance budget:** publication stays event-driven with no new polling or
  subprocesses. One mobile projection clones the status snapshot once, builds
  pane/handle indexes once, and has a deterministic call-count test; lifecycle
  cleanup is bounded by the existing status and handle inventories, and orcad
  tests prove listeners clean up once on failed startup and repeated stop.
- **Diagnostics:** existing hook-listener errors name the pane and PTY, while
  status-store tests pin delivery versus evidence clocks. No new telemetry or
  raw terminal data is emitted.
- **Residual gaps:** rendered Electron/mobile behavior, live SSH reconnect, and
  Linux/Windows/WSL execution require the platform QA pass. The current
  cross-version gate does not cover `session.tabs` content.

## Verification

- Unit: ingest a structured summary and read it back through
  `getStatusSnapshot`, `worktree ps`, and the mobile projection; assert the
  serializer never writes a row carrying `structuredHost`; assert a hydrated
  file that somehow contains one is dropped.
- Unit: the `worktree ps` suites written against the retained store are rewired
  to a real `AgentHookServer` (`agent-status-store-wiring.test-fixture.ts`)
  rather than deleted, so each still asserts the listing behavior it named. The
  dismissal change is pinned end to end in
  `orca-runtime-tests/worktree-ps-agent-row-dismissal.spec.ts`, which fails with
  the retained store restored.
- Live: the parity check from #19217 (working, done, close, reload) repeated
  against the merged store, with both surfaces read from the one row.

## Retired OMP pane recovery

A desktop renderer retirement carries an optional UUID through the existing
`agentStatus:retirePaneAuthority` IPC message. The hook server retains it with
its bounded retirement fence. A validated live OMP new turn consumes that UUID
and echoes `authorityRestartId` only in the live notification. Cached rows,
persistence and startup replay never carry the acknowledgement. Older peers
omit or ignore it and retain explicit attach restoration.

The renderer keeps the UUID in its existing non-persisted retirement tombstone;
every re-retirement mints a new one. A matching acknowledgement may clear that
tombstone only with a successful status write for the existing pane and matching
workspace/connection. Closed tombstones remain `true`, including after the tab
LRU evicts its entry. Closing a retired physical alias revokes its whole group.
This is control-plane retirement correlation, not a second agent-status store.

Fallback restores the hook server's recorded status aliases through the existing
attach-restoration path. The accepted renderer write restores the matching status
alias routes too, preserving group membership for the next retirement. It does
not restore orchestration or launch credentials.
It is scoped to the requesting desktop renderer. A different window's retirement
UUID cannot be cleared by the acknowledgement, and web mirrors keep their existing
host-snapshot/attach behavior.
