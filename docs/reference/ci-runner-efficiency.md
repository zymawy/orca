# CI efficiency and runner capacity

The [September 28 demand rollout](ci-demand-rollout.md) documents staged checks,
unit-selection evidence, Bun qualification, review cancellation and daily occupancy reports.

## September 27 follow-up

### Shared E2E CLI output

E2E consumers previously compiled the CLI individually even though they downloaded
shared Electron, web, and relay output. The producer now compiles the CLI once,
in parallel with web projection after Electron has finished clearing `out/main`.
Consumers repair executable permissions and install their own dev launcher with
the same preparation script used by local CLI builds. Older refs without that
script retain their original per-consumer compilation.

An [eight-sample comparison](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36307081200)
measured producer time increasing from 26.3–27.9s to 38.8–41.0s, while consumer
CLI compilation fell from 20.9–21.2s to 0.06–0.07s of direct preparation. All 5,519
output files matched byte-for-byte, and every sample passed the CLI help smoke.
A four-sample
[final implementation comparison](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36307382635)
also passed parity and CLI smoke checks. Consumer compilation took 4.7 / 12.8s
versus 0.08 / 0.06s of preparation; producer time increased by 0.2 / 7.1s in
the paired trials. Across both runs this models roughly 1.1–4.7 aggregate runner
minutes saved across 14 consumers, before artifact transfer overhead. Runner
variation is substantial; this is not a measured workflow wall-time reduction.
Test coverage and deadlines stay intact.


[PR #23368](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/23368) overlaps shell installation
with dependency setup, starts localization extraction before the orcad smoke,
and prepares mobile route snapshots while WebKit and the bundle are being built.
Its 27 checks passed without retries; seven existing conditional checks skipped.

Same-runner comparisons in both orders measured:

| Work | Before | After | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Static block | 63.5 / 74.7s | 38.9 / 55.6s | [Full comparisons](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36302208990) |
| Shell job, downloads warmed equally | 76.8 / 70.3s | 64.4 / 64.0s | [Controlled shell runs](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36302612626) |
| Mobile preparation | 19.8–21.6s | 18.0–18.5s | [Eight measurements](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36302877583) |
| Web projection and mobile build | 17.2–17.3s | 11.7–12.1s | [Eight measurements](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36302974324) |
| Mobile verifier fixture suite | 25.47 / 25.35s | 20.04 / 19.92s | [Four full-suite runs](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36302692823) |
| E2E build outputs | 28.6–30.4s | 25.8–27.8s | [Eight measurements](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36304001325) |

Full mobile-job timings were dominated by first-run apt installation and browser
test variation; the controlled preparation measurement is the scheduling evidence.
All 1,248 web/mobile output files matched byte-for-byte in the build comparison.
The fixture suite kept all 47 tests, isolated mutable copies, and the verifier's
two fresh builds. No deadline, isolation, or worker-count changes were needed.

E2E builds reuse the existing isolated main/preload/renderer build wrapper, now
forwarding `--mode e2e` to each target. All 2,640 output files matched byte-for-byte
in both execution orders, including the exposed test store and relay artifacts.
This saves a few build seconds; it does not speed up the E2E tests themselves.

The existing unit assignment was already balanced at about 919 historical
worker-seconds per shard; fresh x86 elapsed times still ranged from 254 to 433s.
Refreshing weights alone would encode runner variation rather than resolve it.
An [identical-source architecture pilot](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36302250920)
ran shards 1 and 8 on both four-CPU hosted runners. Complete jobs improved from
449 to 404s and 461 to 384s on ARM, including setup; test and skip counts matched.
A [full ARM run](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36302906752) then passed
all eight shards in 329–373 test seconds (365–412 job seconds). Uploaded reports
matched the same complete x86 assignment: 9,876 files, each exactly once, no
unhandled errors. These are elapsed samples excluding queue time, not a guarantee
that every ARM allocation is faster than every x86 allocation.

PR unit shards and their cache primer now use ARM; a main-branch warmer seeds
that architecture's existing native and pnpm cache keys. Native, package, and
relay gates continue on x86. The daily workflow retains complete x86 coverage on
both Node 24 and Node 26, including relay integration. Thus PR unit architecture
changes, while x86 unit coverage remains scheduled; this is an explicit coverage
placement tradeoff rather than a claim of identical per-PR host coverage.

PR validation exposed a WebRTC probe timeout inside a hidden renderer. Isolated
and four-concurrent probes passed on both architectures; the original cause is
unproven. The probe now uses Electron main for the same three-second observation
interval. A [fault-injection comparison](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36304349257)
passed with renderer timers unavailable on both architectures, while the original
probe failed the negative control. Packet assertions and deadlines are unchanged.
A subsequent Windows run timed out in the installer's real CIM process query
after verifying restricted policy. Its unchanged probe now runs before the
concurrent native suite, removing that source of contention without relaxing
the twenty-second process deadline or dropping either PowerShell architecture.

Replacing Vitest deep comparisons with Node assertions in the status-store
oracle saved only about one local second in an initial trial. The change was
not retained: that evidence did not justify changing assertion semantics.

The combined root/mobile pnpm cache is now present on main and was restored in
the September 27 static comparison, so another warmer for that key is unnecessary.

A [fixture-warmer overlap trial](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36303613587)
ran faster after initialization but exposed a first-use action-download race:
both background composites downloaded `actions/cache@v5` simultaneously, and
one briefly could not find `restore/action.yml`. The existing cache fallback
rebuilt the image and the job passed, but that recovery erased the speedup.
Keep the dedicated warmer serial. PR package restores remain safe from this
observed first-use race because their earlier top-level cache action is loaded
before the composites start; the workflow contract now preserves that ordering.

## Four follow-up changes

- Keep the readiness event, but reuse required checks only after an Actions API
  lookup proves that the same PR head, tested merge commit, and workflow commit
  already completed successfully. A changed base, missing proof, failed lookup,
  or still-running check falls back to the full checks. Advisory tests retain
  their normal readiness routing. The mobile and line-count workflows have no
  draft-dependent work, so they no longer run again when a draft becomes ready.
- Route the Bun matrix using the actual headless build and selected tests'
  transitive imports, with conservative inclusion for dynamic workers, native
  inputs, fixtures, and toolchain changes. A graph failure runs the full matrix;
  manual dispatch still runs all ten platform jobs. The shared test selectors
  retain the same 85 files. Unrelated shard timings and mobile-test tooling can
  skip the matrix; shared shortcut definitions remain real runtime dependencies
  and still run it. Building the graph does not execute the imported modules.
- Restore pnpm stores on PRs using setup-node's existing key and store path,
  without publishing more PR-private copies. Non-PR setup-node caching and
  native/TypeScript caches keep their existing behavior. A missing main store
  still installs with the frozen lockfile. The mixed root/mobile store may miss
  repeatedly because the existing main warmer only seeds the root lockfile.
- Batch only the PowerShell quota-fixture reservations within each test, using
  the original generated scripts in fresh local scopes. Commands under test
  retain separate processes, real file identities, and existing race assertions.
  A traced local run confirms 44 PowerShell starts become 24, with all 21 cases
  passing. Alternating after/before/after elapsed times were 50.00/59.28/37.00
  seconds on a shared macOS arm64 host; that variance does not justify a precise
  percentage or hosted runner-time claim. Test budgets and worker counts are
  unchanged.

The reproducible pnpm-store comparison is
`ORCA_BACKGROUND_LAUNCH=1 node config/scripts/ci-pnpm-store-benchmark.mjs --samples=3`.
On macOS arm64 with BSD tar, three alternating fresh-store pairs eliminated a
median 332,746,995-byte archive per miss. Median install time was 17.33 seconds
before and 16.94 after; the removed archive step alone took 53.51 seconds.
Those local disk/CPU measurements exclude uploads and are not a prediction of
Linux or Windows hosted savings. Restore cost is common to both policies.

## September 26 verification

[PR #23053](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/23053) was merged before its
latest full run finished. That run,
[36221874572](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36221874572), ultimately
failed the mobile pending-frame precondition, just as the previous run had.
All eight unit shards passed, but the aggregate did not. An unchanged assertion
was not enough evidence to label the failure an unrelated flake.

Main subsequently received the deterministic frame hold in PR #22635. The real
terminal refit now queues a frame that the recorder holds until disposal has
finished, then releases surviving work against a remounted terminal. This
follow-up adds a negative control: cancellation is disabled only during disposal,
and the same recorder must report a document-owned callback after disposal.
The normal case retains its pending-work and zero-leak assertions. Both cases
passed five fresh headless Chromium runs locally; the complete terminal-render
file passed all 13 tests. Browser dependencies were required, so these were real
render checks rather than skipped bundles.

Unit model tests now import Monaco's editor API directly, preserving real models
and undo stacks without loading every language contribution. The registry bridge
requires only the editor and URI interfaces it actually uses. The full application
still imports its existing Monaco entry point; no production runtime behavior,
assertions, worker counts, timeouts or isolation settings changed.
A controlled local comparison (macOS arm64, Node 26.6.0, Vitest 4.1.11,
`--maxWorkers=1` only for this comparison) kept six files and all 32 tests.
Three warm original samples took 14.53/12.84/11.62 seconds; three editor-API
samples took 12.95/9.81/7.99 seconds, alternating back to the original imports
between measurements. Median elapsed time fell 12.84 to 9.81 seconds (23.6%);
median import time fell 10.73 to 7.94 seconds (26.0%). The initial cold original
sample, 20.29 seconds, is excluded. Shared-host variance remains; this is a
focused measurement, not a claim of a 23.6% improvement to the full unit suite.

The default-branch warmer
[36221917346](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36221917346) successfully
published native modules and TypeScript state. Fresh PRs
[#23101](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/23101) and
[#23104](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/23104) restored both on their first
runs. Scope inventories showed neither PR had a private copy; the TypeScript
key existed only on main. Native restore took 0.45/0.54 seconds; TypeScript restore
took 0.38/1.31 seconds, with compiler steps of 8/39 seconds versus the warmer's
80-second cold compiler step. PR #23104 used the prefix fallback after its base
advanced, confirming reuse across commits as well as PRs.

The same warmer saved a 22.5 MB Git cache, but the exact key disappeared before
it was reused. Quota eviction is plausible, not proven: the usage API reported
17.48 GiB while a separate live 100-entry sample contained 15.15 GiB of pnpm
stores alone. These rapidly changing inventories are not atomic. The root-only
warmer does not seed the root-plus-mobile download-store key used by static
analysis, so both fresh PRs saved another roughly 350 MiB store. Controlling that
cache duplication is a remaining opportunity; hourly warming alone cannot
promise retention. Git's checksum-verified cold-build fallback remains required.

The unit scheduling baseline now comes from all eight successful Node 24 shards in
[run 36294142683](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36294142683).
All 9,847 measurements match current discovery exactly once; the previous baseline
had 165 unmeasured files and one deleted path. Applying the same measurements to
both assignments reduces the largest projected load from 1,043.811 to 919.695
worker-seconds (11.9%). This is a scheduling projection, not an elapsed-time claim;
runner variation remains visible in the source run. See
[provenance and reproduction](../../config/scripts/ci-shard-timings.md).

## Recording compilation reuse

[Benchmark run 36295773765](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36295773765)
compared the complete mobile suite on two hosted runners in opposite orders.
Compilation reuse reduced elapsed time from 439.002 to 138.308 seconds and from
560.926 to 200.751 seconds (64–68%). Each run preserved all 9,629 original test
verdicts and passed four additional cache regression tests. Compiled code is
bounded to 512 entries; exports, dependencies, and scenario state remain fresh.

Splitting family recordings across four files took 145.165 and 217.226 seconds,
5–8% slower than compilation reuse alone, so the original suite structure stays.
All 787 goldens were regenerated from the unchanged pinned product tree; only
the recorder digest changed, with identical recording bodies and value pools.

Desktop validation in [run 36295671576](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36295671576)
passed all eight shards. The longest test step was 419 seconds versus 429 in the
source run; summed test time was 3,028 versus 3,031 seconds. Runner variation
prevents attributing that small elapsed-time difference solely to the weights.

## September 25 follow-up

The current queue is a bigger part of PR latency than setup. Successful full PR
[36212793136](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36212793136) used
**74.6 aggregate runner-minutes**, including **55.5** for its eight unit shards.
Those jobs ran for 315–448 seconds but waited 229–1,076 seconds to start. The
three-second final `verify` job waited another 264 seconds. These are observed
job creation-to-start and start-to-completion intervals, not billing figures.

This follow-up keeps the existing tests, isolation, eight unit shards, platform
coverage, and release behavior:

- Make the reusable unit-test call and final aggregate respect cancellation.
  Their old `always()` conditions kept superseded work alive despite workflow
  cancellation. In [36215475069](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36215475069),
  a newer push cancelled ordinary jobs while all eight unit shards remained
  queued and the replacement workflow remained pending. `!cancelled()` still
  evaluates after failed/skipped dependencies, without resisting cancellation.
  Two other superseded PR runs reproduced this: at 04:27 UTC on September 26,
  [36216165253](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36216165253) and
  [36215543186](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36215543186) still held
  11 runners, with two more obsolete jobs queued. They had consumed another
  71.3 runner-minutes after replacement pushes. After rechecking current PR heads
  and replacement runs, both obsolete runs were force-cancelled; their replacements
  left the blocked pending state.
- Combine root/README guards with change detection. A real sparse checkout kept
  all 29,487 index entries while materializing only 12 files (192 KB). This
  eliminates one runner allocation and checkout per PR. README link checks still
  see tracked targets outside the working tree and run on docs-only PRs.
- Use free `ubuntu-slim` containers for small guard/aggregate/API jobs; trial
  free `ubuntu-24.04-arm` for typechecking, which needs no native runtime.
  Both share the account's standard concurrency limit. Different labels do
  **not** grant extra concurrent jobs; hosted timings determine their value.
- Cancel superseded PR attempts in the Git termination, Pi owner, and Pi provider
  runtime workflows, retaining independent manual runs.
- Fetch only complete HEAD ancestry for cloud secret scanning. The old checkout
  fetched every branch and tag and took 55 seconds in
  [36214130174](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36214130174).
  Real Git fixtures prove both merge parents and deleted historical contents
  still produce the identical scanned patches.
- Remove the cloud lockfile from the eight unit shards' download-cache key; the
  dedicated relay integration job still includes it. Record actual per-file
  environment, setup, import, and test durations for the existing shard planner.
  Shard 4 spent 535 worker-seconds importing and 357 executing tests; a uniform
  per-file import estimate misses that cost. See [timing refresh](../../config/scripts/ci-shard-timings.md).
- Seed Node 24 native modules, the pinned Git compatibility binary, and TypeScript
  state on the default branch, hourly
  and when dependency/toolchain inputs change. One ten-minute-bounded hosted job
  reuses existing cache keys and skips typechecking an already-cached commit.
  New PRs can restore default-branch caches, while caches saved by another PR
  are inaccessible. The audit found 80 entries totaling 10.67 GiB, including
  9.31 GiB of pnpm stores, but no main-branch Node 24 native or TypeScript state.
  Seven PRs held separate copies of the same pnpm key (2.36 GB combined).
  Git preparation now has one shared action with the unchanged cache key,
  checksum, and build command. In
  [36212101873](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36212101873), a new PR
  spent 40 seconds compiling the same Git 2.25.5 binary; main-branch warming
  makes that cache available to new PRs too.

The hosted trial also removes repeated work in mobile bundle checks. The
builder keeps private snapshots of the default real output for read-only checks
(15 identical builds become two), and haptics checks reuse each route closure
(32 builds become eight). Determinism, custom inputs, malformed routes, stale
outputs, and tampered manifests retain independent builds. A mutation regression
proves Buffer/manifest consumers cannot change another assertion's fixture.
The grant census reuses parsed references for unchanged file contents, still
reads source every time, and has a real-file edit invalidation regression.
The first hosted mobile lane used 400 seconds for its 448 tests; the grant
census alone took 259 seconds. Locally, the same one-worker invocation of the
three changed files fell from 243.07 seconds (101 passing tests) to 49.49 seconds
(103 passing tests). Hosted run
[36217238462](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36217238462) retained
the same 43 files and passed all 450 tests: the original 448 plus two regressions.
Its test step fell from 400.26 to 205.17 seconds, and the complete job fell from
498 to 298 seconds (40% less runner time). Builder, haptics, and grant-census file
times fell from 73.70/88.94/258.58 seconds to 29.24/32.98/22.58 seconds.
The later default-worker verification retained the same 450-test coverage, but
its unchanged terminal-render test failed twice on the pre-existing timing
assertion that a frame must be pending at disposal (`expected 0 to be greater
than 0`). Its other 449 tests passed; no mobile source or assertion was relaxed.

A four-worker experiment reduced aggregate unit job time from 3,386 to 3,133
seconds (7.5%), but the repeat run exceeded the palette matcher's existing
180ms performance budget at 235ms. The override was removed; retain Vitest's
default worker count, isolation, timeouts, retries, and coverage. The first trial
also found an outdated hook-order snapshot after main added three layout-persistence
hooks. That snapshot was refreshed only after comparing the exact old and merged
hook sequences. Final verification is linked from
[PR #23053](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/23053). Failed timing reports
never replace the checked-in baseline.

No account settings, paid services, or runner entitlements changed. Standard
public-repository runners remain free. GitHub documents plan concurrency limits
of Free 20, Pro 40, Team 60, Enterprise 500, and permits support requests for
increases. The organization's actual entitlement was not exposed by the API.
See [runner specifications](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/github-hosted-runners)
and [concurrency limits](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/limits).

Hosted observations from [PR run 36215718607](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36215718607):

| Check                                     | Earlier sample |        Trial | Result               |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------: | -----------: | -------------------- |
| Detection plus repository guards          |  54s, two jobs | 26s, one job | Passed               |
| Typecheck (whole job)                     |       109s x64 |      81s ARM | Passed               |
| Typecheck command, cold incremental state |        76s x64 |      51s ARM | Passed               |
| Cloud secret scan (whole job)             |            69s |          55s | Passed               |
| Cloud checkout/history fetch              |            55s |          40s | Identical scan scope |

The [warmup trial](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/36215718295)
passed in 54 seconds. Its x64 compiler restored the ARM job's incremental state
and rechecked the same source in eight seconds. Unit shard 3 subsequently
restored its pnpm/native cache keys successfully. Actual sharing across different
PRs requires the producer to land on the default branch; this trial validates
commands and key compatibility, not a completed default-branch rollout.
The follow-up warmup built the Git binary in 40 seconds; the PR Git check restored
that exact key and passed in 62 seconds overall. Its TypeScript refresh took
seven seconds after restoring earlier incremental state.

These are small observational samples from different revisions, not controlled
benchmarks. The cold typecheck log confirms an incremental-cache miss. Queue
changes must be separated from active duration and concurrent account traffic.
At the time of that trial, checked-in shard weights were unchanged; the September
26 refresh above now uses the complete successful unit reports.

## September 5 audit

Audit date: September 5, 2026. No paid capacity or provider configuration changed.

## Measurements and changes

Three recent successful PR runs used 54.6–64.9 aggregate runner minutes:
[33998366568](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/33998366568),
[33998220287](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/33998220287), and
[33998181502](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/33998181502).
These are sums of active job durations, excluding skipped jobs; they are not
billing minutes or queue time. This small sample is not a historical average.

- Consolidate E2E routing into the existing code-path detector. The removed
  detector occupied 20–22 seconds and required another runner allocation and
  full-history checkout per nondraft code PR. The same routing commands remain,
  including SSH and native IME selection; actual E2E results remain advisory.
  A routing-script error now fails the required code-path detector.
- Use gzip for PR-only Debian/RPM artifacts. The two sampled Linux packaging
  jobs took 8m10s and 8m19s overall; one spent 3m47s in electron-builder. Its
  default Debian/RPM compression is xz. PR artifacts are inspected on the same
  runner, so their download size offers no benefit. Keep all AppImage, Debian,
  RPM, payload, launcher, and shutdown checks. Release compression is unchanged.
  Hosted validation in [33999422341](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/33999422341)
  reduced the package-build step to 2m13s and the full Linux job to 6m17s, with
  all existing checks passing. This is a small observational sample.
- Cancel superseded Mobile Checks and Skill update round-trip PR runs. The
  skill matrix has 13 jobs. Preserve non-cancelling main/merge-group skill runs,
  with separate concurrency groups per event.
- Reuse the existing script-free root dependency action in Mobile Checks,
  including the pnpm cache keyed by both root and mobile lockfiles. The root
  install remains necessary because mobile types import root dependencies.

The repository already has eight unit shards, path-scoped platform checks,
native caches, one shared E2E build, PR cancellation, incremental TypeScript
caching, and changed-spec E2E routing. Increasing shards would increase setup
work and simultaneous runner demand. Do not adjust the count without comparing
critical-path time and aggregate job time on the same commit.

## Follow-up savings

- Move the hourly main/release freshness lookup to a five-minute Ubuntu
  preflight without a checkout. In unchanged run
  [33986205749](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/33986205749),
  Blacksmith macOS was occupied for 40 seconds, including a 30-second checkout,
  before skipping. The new job-level gate avoids that Mac allocation. Actual
  builds gain an Ubuntu scheduling hop; pin the Mac checkout and downstream
  Windows identity to the SHA that the preflight checked.
- Avoid global `npm install -g node-gyp` for validated Linux Node-runtime cache
  hits. Use the existing native-module load/provenance check before skipping;
  misses, broken addons, and Electron jobs still install the rebuild toolchain.
  The action file participates in cache keys, so this rollout creates fresh
  native caches once. No measured warm-cache seconds are claimed yet.

## Runner recommendations

The repository is **public**, verified using the GitHub API. Standard
GitHub-hosted Linux, Windows, and macOS runners have free compute minutes for
public repositories. Queue pressure and third-party provider allowances still
matter; artifact storage and larger runners have separate billing rules.
See [GitHub Actions billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions).

1. Keep standard GitHub-hosted runners as the default. Ask GitHub Support for a
   higher concurrent-job limit before paying for more capacity. The documented
   standard limits depend on the account plan (Free: 20 total/5 macOS; Team:
   60/5; Enterprise: 500/50), and increases are subject to approval. The actual
   account entitlement was not verified. See [limits](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/limits).
2. Reserve existing Blacksmith allowance for macOS if that is the priority.
   Blacksmith documents 3,000 free x64 2-vCPU-equivalent minutes per organization;
   a 6-vCPU Mac minute consumes 20 equivalents, or 150 actual Mac minutes if
   it uses the entire free pool. Cloud workflows also use Blacksmith Linux.
   Moving Linux to hosted GitHub saves shared allowance, but does not necessarily
   free Mac hardware capacity. Account-specific contracts and usage were not
   inspected. See [Blacksmith runners](https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-runners/overview).
3. Treat Ubicloud as an optional small Linux overflow trial. Its documented
   $2.50 monthly credit buys 1,250 premium 2-vCPU minutes at $0.002/minute, or
   2,000 standard 2-vCPU minutes at $0.00125/minute. New accounts default to
   premium and require a credit card. No enforceable hard spending cap was
   verified, so changing runner labels cannot guarantee the no-spend constraint.
   One PR's roughly 55–65 runner minutes also makes clear how small this pool
   is relative to repository activity (hardware speeds differ).

### A bounded Ubicloud candidate

The Linux leg of `performance-contracts.yml` took 48 seconds in
[33994756657](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/33994756657).
Its daily schedule and 20-minute timeout make it a small candidate: 31 ordinary
scheduled attempts permit at most 620 job-runtime minutes, before runner
startup/cleanup billing. Actual timings on Ubicloud's 2-vCPU hardware still need
measurement; the GitHub timing is only a sizing reference.

If enabled later, route only the first attempt of the scheduled Linux job to
Ubicloud; keep PRs, manual dispatches, reruns, and macOS/Windows on GitHub. This
avoids spending the allowance on unpredictable PR volume. Check other account
usage and available credit before enabling; a workflow timeout is not an
account-wide billing cap. On September 5, the organization's GitHub App
installation list contained Blacksmith but no Ubicloud installation, so this
follow-up leaves runner selection on GitHub rather than queueing work against
an unprovisioned label.

## Machines that also run coding agents

Do not register the credentialed host directly as a public-PR runner. A PR can
execute arbitrary build/test code, and a persistent host lets it access local
credentials or affect subsequent jobs. Docker alone is not adequate isolation
when it exposes the host home, Docker socket, SSH agent, or office network.

A possible no-new-hardware experiment is a disposable VM per job, preferably on
a dedicated spare machine, with a just-in-time single-job runner, no shared
home/keychain/SSH agent or host mounts, restricted network access, and CPU/RAM
limits that leave room for coding agents. Destroy the VM after every job;
ephemeral runner registration by itself does not clean the machine. Start with
trusted branch/manual workloads and keep public fork PRs on hosted runners.
Provisioning and ongoing patching are real operational costs even when the
machine is already owned. See GitHub's
[self-hosted runner security guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions).

## Release waits

The latest successful sampled Windows release used 13m59s of a 21m56s job in
signing wait/download steps. The same release held an Ubuntu job for 11m38s
polling the isolated Mac build. These are stronger occupancy opportunities than
small checkout savings, especially when approval takes hours.

[Windows signing without occupying a runner](windows-signing-runner-time.md)
describes a staged, same-run design, required protected environments, and
rehearsal criteria. No callback integration or protected Windows signing
environments currently exist. An environment-gated design adds a GitHub
approval after each SignPath approval and changes the current automatic inner
signing timeout fallback; those are explicit release-policy decisions, so this
PR leaves production signing behavior unchanged.

## Second audit and hosted trials

- Cloud Verify ran 100 times in a sampled 39-hour window (84 PR and 16 push
  runs). Move its four Ubuntu 22.04 jobs from Blacksmith to standard hosted
  Ubuntu 22.04, preserving Postgres, secret scanning, build, tests, and Terraform
  validation. Baseline [34001538145](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/34001538145)
  used 64/72/26/19 seconds for security/test/build/Terraform respectively.
  This conserves the shared provider allowance; hosted latency must be checked.
- Keep full tag history for the 13-job skill round-trip matrix, but fetch blobs
  lazily. Only two historical SKILL.md files are materialized. Baseline
  [33999994876](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/33999994876)
  spent 42–84 seconds per checkout, about 14 aggregate runner minutes. A hosted
  trial must verify historical blob fetches on all three operating systems.
- Use the existing Electron/native dependency cache for native IME CI. Keep
  both deterministic boundary and real IBus tests. Add pnpm store caching to
  terminal perf and release golden/evidence lanes; retain their raw installs
  because manually selected older refs may not contain the shared action.
- Disable ZIP recompression only for already-compressed NSIS installers sent
  to SignPath. Installer contents, release compression, and signing stay intact.
- Advance existing placement and startup deadlines with scoped fake timers in
  three renderer test files. All 34 tests pass in 62 ms of local test execution,
  versus 65.182 seconds in the sampled hosted baseline. Imports and transforms
  still dominate invocation time; this is not a claim of equal PR wall savings.

Eight unit shards already have balanced 260–296-second sample durations.
Reducing shards or removing test isolation lacks evidence of a net gain. Real
subprocess tests intentionally cover lifecycle behavior and retain real clocks.
The 14-way E2E split retains headroom after earlier 12-way timeouts. Lowering
coverage or schedule frequency is outside this efficiency pass. Cache complexity
for a seven-second docs install is unlikely to pay back. Release build reuse
across modes risks differing telemetry identities and native platform artifacts.

Terminal Perf's baseline [33955846492](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/33955846492)
failed waiting 30 seconds for workspaceSessionReady in its shared-page fixture,
before measuring terminal performance. Compare hosted trials against that known
failure rather than attributing it to dependency cache changes.

Hosted trials for the second audit:

- [Cloud Verify 34002295216](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/34002295216)
  passed all four jobs on standard hosted Ubuntu: security 57s, test 102s, build
  35s, Terraform 19s. The test lane is 30s slower than the Blacksmith sample;
  retain this modest latency tradeoff to conserve shared allowance.
- [Skill matrix 34002295221](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/34002295221)
  passed all 13 legs, including historical blob materialization. Checkout took
  18–20s on Linux, 39–45s on macOS, and 49–58s on Windows, versus the earlier
  42–84s range across platforms. These are observational samples.
- [Native IME 34002299594](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/34002299594)
  passed both deterministic and real IBus checks. Shared dependency setup took
  29s, versus 35s for the old install/toolchain steps in the sampled baseline.
- Native-IME-only source/spec changes no longer allocate the reusable E2E
  build, cache, and consumer jobs just to filter out the native spec. The
  separate native workflow still runs; SSH-only and mixed spec lists still
  allocate the reusable workflow. Routing contracts exercise these cases.
- [Hourly 34001816449](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/34001816449)
  exercised the new five-second preflight and successfully published macOS.
  The Windows follow-up failed in its unchanged input-vetting fetch because
  remote refs differ only by case on its case-insensitive filesystem. The
  requested SHA was correct; this does not validate an unchanged-main skip yet.

Moving the daily Mac freshness check has lower expected value than hourly:
only one potential idle allocation per day, and active development usually
requires that build. Defer another release-graph change until skip frequency
justifies it. The substantive remaining release occupancy opportunity is the
separately documented asynchronous signing policy decision.
