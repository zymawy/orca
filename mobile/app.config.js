// Why this file exists: a bare "expo-notifications" plugin entry writes
// `aps-environment: development` into the iOS entitlements, while push-token.ts
// reports `production` for every non-__DEV__ build. A TestFlight or App Store build
// would then register a production APNs token against a sandbox entitlement, and the
// gateway's pushes would be accepted by Apple and delivered nowhere. Deriving the
// mode from an env var the release workflow sets makes the two agree by construction
// instead of relying on the export step to rewrite the entitlement.
//
// app.json stays the source for everything else: Expo reads it first and hands it to
// this function, so the fastlane version/buildNumber rewrite still flows through.
