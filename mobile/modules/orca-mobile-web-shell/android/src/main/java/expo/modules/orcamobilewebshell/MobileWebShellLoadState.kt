 * failure the caller has already acted on. Consecutive duplicates are dropped as well.
 *
 * Pure, and the same rule on both platforms, so a JVM test and a `swiftc` check can hold it. The
 * two fields a caller reads directly are volatile: Android decides a document failure from
 * `shouldInterceptRequest`, which Chromium does not run on the UI thread.
