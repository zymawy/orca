 * Guards the two claims `mobile/rpc-foundation/goldens` makes about its pin.
 *
 * `ancestry`  — `baseline` names a commit in this history. A behaviour-change branch pins its own
 *               last fenced commit; that commit stops being reachable the moment the branch
 *               squash-merges, and nobody can run `--record` on main again until a hand-made repin
 *               lands. Ordinary product drift past a reachable pin is normal and is not a failure.
 * `reproduce` — the goldens on disk are what the recorder produces from the PINNED tree. The
 *               recording suites replay the corpus against the CURRENT tree on every run, which is
 *               the same claim only while the fenced tree still matches the pin.
