/**
 * Diff review, from the desktop's bundle or from this app.
 *
 * The files switch's shape. What is different here is that the native screen is a component rather
 * than the body of this file: `MobileDiffReviewRouteScreen` calls the review controller, and a
 * controller at this file's top level would subscribe behind the page as well as in front of it.
 * As an element it is built and not mounted, and only `fallback` ever mounts it.
 *
 * `matchesRoutePattern` is segment-count exact with literal equality on the static segments, so
 * these five segments collide with nothing: the explorer's five carry `files`.
