/**
 * The source-control hub, from the desktop's bundle or from this app.
 *
 * The files switch's shape, for its reasons: the shell answers `native-route` for a route the
 * bundle does not list or this app's grants do not cover, and `fallback` is what that renders.
 * A flag read still settling is a third answer and paints neither renderer; see
 * `shell-switch-decision.ts`.
 *
 * `pr` and `history` are not switched and never will be. Both are `Redirect`s into this route, and
 * a redirect inside the page would leave the session bound to a pathname the page has left; left
 * native they replace into this route, whose switch then mounts the shell. One extra native frame.
