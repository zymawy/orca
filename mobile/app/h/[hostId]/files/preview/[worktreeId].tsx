/**
 * The file preview, from the desktop's bundle or from this app.
 *
 * Normalized before the switch, not after: a route the native screen would refuse is one the shell
 * has no pathname to build from, and its own refusal message is a better screen than a page opened
 * on params it will refuse again.
 *
 * Only the two path segments are spelled into the pathname; everything else — the file path among
 * them — is a param, which is what keeps a `/`, a space or a `..` out of the segment vocabulary the
 * bridge holds a route to.
