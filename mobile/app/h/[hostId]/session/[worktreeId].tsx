/**
 * The session screen — terminal and chat — from the desktop's bundle or from this app.
 *
 * The review switch's shape, for its reasons: the native screen is `MobileSessionRouteScreen`
 * rather than the body of this file, because `useMobileSessionController` at this file's top level
 * would open the terminal, chat and tab subscriptions behind the page as well as in front of it.
 * As an element it is built and not mounted, and only `fallback` ever mounts it.
 *
 * Four query params rather than the review's four, and one of them is not part of this screen's
 * identity: `paneKey`. A notification tap for a pane of the session already on screen is a tab
 * switch, so keying on it would tear the bridge down and reload the page for one, and keying on it
 * while the page cleared its own copy lost a repeat tap outright (ruling 33.1). It travels as a
 * route update instead — a re-sent `init` to a page that said it takes one — and this file clears
 * the native param once the page has been handed it, exactly as the notification hook did, so no
 * later `init` can replay a spent tap.
