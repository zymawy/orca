/**
 * Agent session history, from the desktop's bundle or from this app.
 *
 * The switch is `index.tsx`'s, for its reasons: the shell renders the page only for a route the
 * bundle lists with grants this app implements, `fallback` is what a negotiation that said no
 * falls back to, and a flag read still settling paints neither renderer.
 *
 * Two dynamic segments rather than one, so both are encoded: `useLocalSearchParams` answers the
 * decoded value, and a worktree id or a deep-linked host id carrying `/`, `?`, `#` or whitespace
 * would otherwise stop being the single segment `matchesRoutePattern` reads it as. A route with no
 * worktree names no screen the shell could open, so it stays native.
 *
 * Encoding does not save a `.` or `..` id, which it leaves unchanged, and that pathname fails the
 * bridge's own segment rule. Handing it over anyway reaches the phone as an `init` naming no
 * screen, which the page answers with "Update Orca to open this workspace" — a failure screen in
 * place of the native panel sitting right behind this switch. So the route asks the schema first
 * and stays native when the answer is no, which is where every route starts.
 *
 * The schema is the predicate rather than a copy of its bounds: two spellings of one rule drift,
 * and the half that matters is the half the page reads. C3.1 made the same call for the files
 * routes first, and every switch now asks the one module beside the schema
 * rather than carrying its own copy of the call.
