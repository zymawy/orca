 * The worktree list, from the desktop's bundle or from this app.
 *
 * The shell decides, not this switch: it renders the page only for a route the bundle lists with
 * grants this app implements, and answers `native-route` otherwise, which is what `fallback` is.
 * So the two ways to stay native are a flag that is off and a negotiation that said no, and the
 * second one covers every host whose desktop is older than the page.
 *
 * The flag read settling is a third answer, not a fourth spelling of native: see
 * `shell-switch-decision.ts`.
 *
 * Encoded, not interpolated raw, for the reason `web.tsx` states: a deep-linked host id carrying
 * `?`, `#` or whitespace would build a pathname the page refuses, and a refusal here is a failure
 * screen rather than the native list this route already has.
