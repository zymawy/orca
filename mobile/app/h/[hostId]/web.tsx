 * The hybrid shell route, dark behind a flag only some builds can turn on.
 *
 * With the flag off — which is every native store build, one built without
 * `EXPO_PUBLIC_MOBILE_SHELL=ota` — this redirects and the screen is never constructed, so nothing
 * is fetched, written or swept. It sits under `app/h/[hostId]` so `HostProtocolGate` in that
 * group's layout still owns the `desktop-too-old` wall above it.
 *
 * Reachable by deep link and from the Troubleshoot row only; no screen links here.
