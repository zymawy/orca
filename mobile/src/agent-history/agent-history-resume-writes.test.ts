/**
 * The three writes a resume makes, answered by the shell's own RPC client instead of the page's.
 *
 * These are the modes no golden replays: the corpus scripts a refusal and a locked terminal, and
 * nothing in it loses a reply or closes the door mid-flight. The claim under test is not that the
 * page has its own handling — it has none, and should have none — but that the descriptor's
 * handling survives the extra hop, so the native screen and the page fail identically.
 *
 * Each case is run twice, once on a client the page holds through the bridge and once on the same
 * fake directly, and the two verdicts are compared rather than written down. A change that moved
 * the native behaviour would move both and pass a written-down expectation.
 *
 * One case has no second leg and cannot have one: a shell that goes away mid-write is something
 * only the bridged transport can do, so there is no native run to compare it against. It asserts
 * the property directly instead, and says so where it is.
