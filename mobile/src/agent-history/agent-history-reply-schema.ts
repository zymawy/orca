 * The capability list the screen gates the whole surface on.
 *
 * `capabilities` sits behind main's own `?.includes` and stays salvaged: a reply without a readable
 * list reads as "this host does not advertise the vault", which is the `unsupported` screen main
 * already showed for it. Individual entries are not narrowed — the list is a growing vocabulary and
 * every read is an `includes` against one known token.
 *
 * The status payload itself is otherwise passed through: the panel hands the whole record to
 * readMobileRuntimeHostPlatform and readMobileRuntimeTerminalWindowsShell, both total guards over
 * `unknown`, so re-declaring what they read here would narrow two members this screen never
 * destructures.

 *

 * into the ready screen state, where the list maps `sessions` and the issue banner counts `issues`
 * — a reply missing either left the screen `ready` over an undefined container and crashed on the
 * next render, which is the defect this reader exists to name.
 *
 * The rows stay unknown, and that is deliberate rather than unfinished. A row is an AiVaultSession,
 * whose `agent` is a 21-arm vocabulary that grows with every agent CLI Orca learns to scan — and
 * which this client echoes straight back to the host when it resumes a session. Declaring it would
 * either refuse a newer host's whole reply or silently drop the very sessions that host added, and
 * the remote-wire contract is explicit that a member a client sends back passes through as the host
 * wrote it rather than through a client-side fallback.

 * statement and a non-array reached every `repos.find` as one. The rows stay unknown for the same
