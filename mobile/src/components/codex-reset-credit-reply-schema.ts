/**
 * The capability list the reset-credit probe reads off `status.get`.
 *
 * `capabilities` is optional and its elements are strings: codex-reset-credit-capability.ts:22
 * guards with `Array.isArray` before `includes`, so absence has always meant "unsupported", and a
 * list carrying a non-string is dropped whole rather than per element — which is the same answer
 * main gave, because `Array.isArray(...) && includes(...)` never matched a number anyway.
 *
 * The operation's `object-result-or-null` policy turns an unreadable reply into `null` rather than
 * a throw, so a foreign payload still reads as "unsupported" at the probe's own `catch`.

 * other, and raises one sentence the confirm sheet shows. Declaring any of that here would split a
 * single refusal rule across two places and let a reply pass the reader and fail the decoder with a
 * different message. The forward is opaque on purpose, not a member left unchecked.
