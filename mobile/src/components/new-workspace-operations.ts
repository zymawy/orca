/**
 * repo.hooks read for the drawer, the second of two policies on this method.
 *
 * The tasks create path (`repo.setup-hooks`) throws the host's message because it cannot decide
 * whether to run setup without an answer. The drawer only decorates a form: a refusal leaves the
 * advanced section on its defaults and the message is never shown, so refusal is a skip here.
 *
 * The skip is also what carries an unreadable reply: the reader answers `compatible: false`, this
 * policy raises `RpcIncompatibleReplyError` naming `repo.hooks`, and
 * use-new-workspace-setup-script.ts:61 catches it into the same default details a property-read
 * throw already landed on.
