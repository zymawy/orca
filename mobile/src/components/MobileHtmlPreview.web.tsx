/**
 * The `sandbox` the preview frame carries, and the whole of what makes it safe to render an
 * agent-produced artifact inside the page's own document.
 *
 * No `allow-scripts`: a script in the artifact does not run. No `allow-same-origin`: the frame is an
 * opaque origin, so it reaches no storage, no cookie and nothing the page holds — and it is not
 * same-origin with the document the shell injects its bridge object into, which Chromium places in
 * every same-origin frame. The shell refuses a non-main-frame bridge message by rule as well, so
 * that fence is two deep.
 *
 * `allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation` is the one capability granted, and it is what keeps a
 * link in the artifact working (ruling 29): a tap becomes a top-frame navigation the shell's
 * navigation policy cancels and hands to its external-link opener. Measured on Chromium and WebKit:
 * a user click produces exactly one top-frame navigation, while a `<meta http-equiv="refresh">`, a
 * form submit and `target="_blank"` produce none, and with scripts deliberately enabled a
 * script-initiated `window.top.location` throws `SecurityError`. Only a human's tap gets out.
 *
 * And only if the shell on the other side of that tap has somewhere to send it. A shell built
 * before the cancelled-navigation event drops the navigation in silence, so `externalNavigation` is
 * asked for first (C8.1, ruling 37.2) and without it the artifact renders with its links as text.
 * Hidden and not degraded: the document paints, the toggle works, the Source tab is untouched.

 * of the two fences the inert-link pass sets -- see `html-preview-inert-links.ts` for why neither
 * stands in for the other. Everything else about the frame is unchanged, opaque origin and all.

/**
 * Web sibling: the artifact rendered in a sealed frame, with the native component's Preview/Source
 * toggle intact.
 *
 * `srcdoc` rather than a `blob:` URL, measured: `srcdoc` is admitted under the policy the shell
 * already ships, because a `srcdoc` frame has no URL to match and inherits its embedder's policy
 * instead, while a `blob:` frame is refused by `frame-src 'none'` on both engines and refused a
 * second time in WebKit by the `frame-ancestors 'none'` it inherits. So this costs no CSP change at
 * all, and the policy stays exactly what the Phase E native build carries.
 *
 * What the inherited policy then governs is everything the artifact tries to fetch: `img-src` bounds
 * its images, `font-src 'none'` refuses a web font, `connect-src 'self'` its XHR, and
 * `script-src 'self'` refuses its inline script even if the sandbox had allowed scripts.
 *
 * Images are the one of those four that is no longer stricter than native. `script-src 'self'`,
 * `font-src 'none'` and `connect-src 'self'` still are -- the native preview is a separate WebView
 * process with no policy on its document, so it runs a script, loads a web font and reaches any
 * host -- but since `img-src` gained `https:` this frame loads a remote image exactly as native
 * does.
 *
 * That image URL is a channel: it fires on view and carries whatever the artifact's author encoded
 * in it, so a rendered artifact can tell its own author it was opened. Nothing dynamic goes with it
 * -- no script runs, so the URL is fixed when the artifact is written. What keeps the document's
 * own origin off that request is the shell's `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` header and not
 * `referrerPolicy` below: measured in the render rig, WebKit sends the embedder's URL from a srcdoc
 * frame's image despite the attribute, where Chromium sends none.
