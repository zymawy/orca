// @vitest-environment happy-dom
/**
 * What the preview mounts for each answer the shell gives, read off the element it renders.
 *
 * Its own file because of how the grant resolves here: this suite runs in a `node` environment whose
 * resolver has no `.web` precedence, so `MobileHtmlPreview.web.tsx`'s import of
 * `./use-html-preview-link-grant` lands on the native sibling, which answers yes unconditionally.
 * That is why `mobile-webview-editor-web-fallbacks.test.tsx` still measures the granted frame
 * without knowing a grant exists, and why the hidden path needs the module replaced to be reached
 * at all.
 *
 * The browser half is `config/scripts/mobile-web-app-html-preview-render.test.mjs`, which resolves
 * the real web sibling and measures what an engine paints and does. This file is the wiring between
 * the two: that the component asks, and that both the frame's sandbox and the document it is handed
 * follow the answer. It runs in the sharded `test` job, where the render rig is skipped for want of
 * the bundler's dependencies.
 *
 * happy-dom rather than the suite's `node` default, because the inerting pass the hidden arm takes
 * parses with the browser's own `DOMParser` and there is none in `node`.
