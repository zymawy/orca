 * The loader's return does not assert it. The artifact is minified vendor output and both members
 * measure as `any` there (a probe assigning `engine.render` to a `number` compiles), and `any`
 * satisfies every signature, so returning it as `PageMermaid` checks the two names and nothing
 * about their shapes. This does: `Mermaid` is precise, so a `PageMermaid` member whose signature
 * the engine does not really have fails here instead of at a call the page makes. It lives beside
 * the type it constrains rather than in a test: `mobile/tsconfig.json` excludes `*.test.ts`, so the
 * app's own typecheck would not cover it there. Tests are typechecked too, by `tsconfig.test.json`
 * through the tests-typecheck ratchet, but that is a second program with a grandfathered baseline
 * and a few files held outside it on purpose, and it is not the gate the shipped build rests on.
 *
 * What no type can check is that the bundle behaves like the package. The render check is that, in
 * both engines, against the native document's own bytes.

 * bytes over the wire and spends 103 of the 256 manifest assets the shell will load. The artifact
