 * to `mermaid.initialize`. Written down twice these would drift, and the drift would be a diagram
 * that looks different on the page from the one on the phone.
 *
 * `suppressErrorRendering` because a diagram that throws is a source box on both hosts: without it
 * mermaid draws its own error diagram into a temporary element and then leaves that element in the
 * document as it rethrows, which on the page is an orphan SVG under nobody's mount.
