/**
 * Web sibling: the same diagram, drawn by mermaid in this document.
 *
 * The native component seals the source inside a `WebView` whose document embeds the whole engine
 * as a string, because `react-native-webview` has no browser counterpart and mermaid has no native
 * renderer. On the page neither half of that applies: mermaid is a browser library, so it is an
 * `import()` rather than a 3.7 MB literal, and there is no second content process to sandbox in.
 *
 * What replaces the sandbox is mermaid's own `securityLevel: 'strict'`, which runs the serialized
 * SVG through DOMPurify before handing it back — a `<script>`, an `on*` attribute or a
 * `javascript:` href in a diagram label reaches this document as nothing at all. That is measured
 * in `config/scripts/mobile-web-app-mermaid-render.test.mjs`, in both engines, against a hostile
 * fixture, and so is the byte equality of the result with the native document's own render. The
 * native path's `</script>` escaping has no analogue here and does not need one: the source is a
 * JS string argument, not text spliced into an inline `<script>`.
 *
 * The import is inside the effect, so a session with no diagram in it evaluates none of the engine
 * (ruling 28). It reaches the engine through `mermaid-page-engine.ts`, which loads one pre-bundled
 * artifact rather than the package: importing the package here emitted 103 scripts, all of them
 * already inside the generation the phone downloaded.
