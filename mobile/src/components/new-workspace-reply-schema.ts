/**
 * The repo's setup hook, as the drawer decorates its advanced section with it.
 *
 * `source` is the one required member: use-new-workspace-setup-script.ts:51 assigns it straight
 * into `SetupHookDetails.source`, whose type is `string | null`, with no guard in between — and the
 * handler always answers it, `null` when no orca.yaml parsed. Nullable rather than optional so the
 * "no hooks file" answer keeps its explicit `null` instead of collapsing to absent.
 *
 * Everything else keeps main's own guards behind it. `hooks` is read through
 * `result.hooks?.scripts?.setup?.trim()` and stays nullable, because the handler returns `null`
 * there for a binary or unparsable orca.yaml. `setupRunPolicy` is a closed enum with the call
 * site's `?? 'run-by-default'` still doing the defaulting: the only two comparisons against it are
 * `!== 'skip-by-default'` and `=== 'ask'`, so an arm this build does not know behaves exactly as
 * main's unrecognised string did. The arms are the host's `SetupRunPolicy`
 * (src/shared/orca-yaml-hook-types.ts:1), which is what `getEffectiveSetupRunPolicy` answers, and
 * they are pinned to it above. `setupTrust` is nullable as well as optional because the
 * `components-setup-ask` fixture sends an explicit `null` — salvaging that as a drop would move a
 * `normal` golden for a reply the host really sends.

 * Total, and that is load-bearing rather than defensive. The call site interprets this reply inside
 * an unawaited `void (async () => {})()` with no catch (use-new-workspace-runtime-context.ts:53),
 * so a refusal would be an unhandled rejection that also skipped `setAvailableProviders` at :97.
 * Main cast the result and read `?.trustedOrcaHooks ?? {}`, which tolerated a reply of any shape,
 * so anything that is not an object decodes as absent and reaches that `?? {}` exactly as before —
 * use-new-workspace-runtime-context.ts:80 takes `ui.value?.trustedOrcaHooks ?? {}`. The record
 * salvages per repo, so one unreadable repo's approvals cannot cost every other repo its trust.
 *
 * The matrix cannot pin this: its mutation vocabulary is absent, null, inner-envelope and refusal,
 * and none of those makes a fulfilled result a non-object. The unit case beside it is the pin.
