/**
 * One dismissible line above the list, in two tones.
 *
 * `notice` is the default and stays monochrome: the host is healthy and the user's target simply
 * went away. `failure` is for an action that did not happen, which the list has to say without
 * taking the screen: color is for state, so it is one red rule and nothing else.
 *
 * Both are inserted into a screen that is already on screen, so a reader who has moved past the top
 * of the list never arrives at one. The tone decides how loudly it is carried to them: a refusal
 * interrupts, and a bounced route waits its turn, because interrupting for the second would train
 * people to ignore the first. `alert` only for the refusal, and no role for the other — React
 * Native has no `status` role, so the polite region is the whole of that answer.
