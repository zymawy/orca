/**
 * The rich Markdown editor document, mounted in the page instead of in a WebView.

 * Same program: the factory the WebView's script is bundled from, called here with the page's own
 * hooks instead of the WebView's window. What the WebView's HTML gave the document — a stylesheet,
 * the markup it reads its surface out of, a `postMessage` back to React Native and a `prompt` for
 * the two commands that need a URL — this supplies instead, through the seams and the host element.
 *
 * A call is a document. Nothing here is shared between two of them and nothing is reset: each call
 * builds its own scope and reads its own surface, so a second editor on the page cannot reach the
 * first one's state and a stale callback from a mount that has gone reads the scope it closed over.
