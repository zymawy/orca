/**
 * The editor's sheet, held under the element the page mounts it in.
 *
 * Inside the WebView the document owns its page, so the sheet says `:root`, `*`, `html` and `body`
 * and means all four. Appended to the head of a React Native Web application those four restyle
 * every screen the shell can show, so ruling 19's rule for `window.onerror` applies to CSS: the
 * page mount may style only what it owns.
 *
 * Where this differs from the terminal's half is what happens to those four. The terminal drops
 * them and repaints through a seam, because the colour it was setting belongs to the application.
 * The editor has no such seam and needs none: the host element *is* the editor's page, so the
 * document's own rules move onto it — the variables the whole sheet reads, the surface colour, the
 * font, the box model — and a bare `p` or `code` still reaches only what is inside it.
