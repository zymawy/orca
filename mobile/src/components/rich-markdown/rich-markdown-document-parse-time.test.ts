/**
 * Rulings 20 and 21 over the editor's document, checked by the readers the terminal's census uses.
 *
 * The hand-written script could read `#editor` and install its listeners as it was parsed, because
 * the WebView re-parses the whole document on every load. These modules are imported, and an ES
 * module body runs once per page: a read or a listener left at a module's top level would hand the
 * page's second mount the first mount's element and install nothing, which is a dead editor that
 * reports itself ready.
 *
 * So every effect lives in a start function both hosts call, and every mutable binding lives on
 * the scope rather than in a module, which is what makes two editors on one page two editors.
