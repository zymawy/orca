 * One rich Markdown editor document, started.

 * The program both hosts run: the WebView loads it as a bundled script that calls this once with
 * no host, and the page imports it and calls it per mount with its own hooks. A call owns
 * everything it touches — the scope below is local to it — so two editors on one page are two
 * editors, and a listener left over from a mount that has gone reads the scope it closed over
 * rather than the live one.
 *
 * The sequence is here rather than derived from a list, because it *is* the document's shape: the
 * surface is read, the listeners that need it are installed, the keyboard measurement starts, and
 * only then is the host told the document is ready.
