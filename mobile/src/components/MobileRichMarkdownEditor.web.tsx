/**
 * Web sibling: the same editor, with the WebView taken out.
 *
 * `react-native-webview` has no web build that renders anything, so what the page does instead is
 * mount the document itself — the modules under `rich-markdown/` are the program the WebView's
 * script is bundled from, called here with the page's own hooks. The toolbar above it is the same
 * row of fifteen the phone renders, and the controller between the two is the same controller, so
 * `MarkdownReader` and the screen around it cannot tell which of the two they have.
 *
 * Two seams are the page's rather than the window's. Messages go to `handleMessage` directly and
 * never through `window.ReactNativeWebView`, which on the page is the *shell's* bridge. The URL the
 * Link and Image commands need comes from `TextInputModal`: `window.prompt` was measured to return
 * null in both shells — neither implements the delegate the dialog needs — so on the phone those
 * two commands silently do nothing, and here they ask.
 *
 * `onKeyboardInsetChange` is accepted and never called, which is correct rather than missing. It
 * exists because native `Keyboard` events under-report a WebView's covered area; on the page the
 * document's `visualViewport` reads and the screen's `keyboard-occlusion.web.ts` are the same
 * measurement of the same viewport with the same formula, so driving the prop would lift the
 * screen's own bar twice. The mount supplies no inset source, so there is nothing to report.
