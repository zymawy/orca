/**
 * Everything of the WebView's page that is not the document itself, pinned byte for byte.
 *
 * The whole-document digest this file used to carry cannot survive C7.10 C1 and does not need to:
 * the script is now an esbuild bundle of `src/components/rich-markdown/` rather than seven string
 * constants a concatenator glued together, so its bytes are the bundler's and the proof that it is
 * the same *document* is `rich-markdown/native-document-bundle.test.ts`, which runs it.
 *
 * What did not move is the page around it — the head, the stylesheet, the markup — and that is
 * still a byte fact worth holding, because a stray character in the CSS is invisible to every
 * behavioural test there is.
 *
 * Two different digests, so which is which:
 *
 * - The one this file used to assert was of main's *whole document*, script included:
 *   `1ef29c8802170800011e8accf1966bc542cdd7dd5c9600bacb6e0860f77b6df8`, 29,852 bytes. It is gone,
 *   and nothing below reproduces it.
 * - `DOCUMENT_SHELL_SHA256` below is of the *page around the script*, the document with its
 *   `<script>` region emptied. It was taken twice — on main's document and on this one — and the
 *   two readings agreed, which is what says the head, the stylesheet and the markup did not move.
