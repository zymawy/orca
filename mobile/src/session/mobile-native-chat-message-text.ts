 *  Why quantize: the chat's `renderItem` closes over `fontScale`, so every
 *  distinct value re-renders and re-measures every message in the list. A raw
 *  pinch proposes a new scale on each gesture frame, so a single zoom drives
 *  hundreds of whole-list re-measures — and because the pinch is composed
 *  `Simultaneous` with the list's own scroll, an incidental second finger during
 *  a scroll starts that storm at scales indistinguishable from 1. Those
 *  re-measures run while rows are mounting and unmounting, which is when a
 *  recycled iOS paragraph view can repaint with the previous row's content
 *  frame and silently drop the tail of a long message. Snapping to steps keeps a
 *  full-range pinch to at most 20 commits and makes a near-neutral pinch commit
 *  nothing at all. */
