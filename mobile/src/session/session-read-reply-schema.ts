// tab's document. Checked against the handlers in src/main/runtime/rpc/methods/ — repo.ts:29,

 * guarded. The row is otherwise passed through, because the strip renders a host record this
 * module does not re-declare; a row with no handle drops rather than failing the refresh, which is
 * what a skip policy means for an inventory the screen treats as "no news".
