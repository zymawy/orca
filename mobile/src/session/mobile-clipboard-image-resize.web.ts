/**
 * Web sibling: the raster shrink as a `<canvas>` draw, which is the one thing the page can do that
 * the native path needed a module and two file writes for.
 *
 * `expo-image-manipulator` is a native module with no browser counterpart, and the temp file its
 * native path writes exists to work around a loader that cannot decode a large base64 data URI —
 * a constraint a browser does not have. The shell's `img-src 'self' data: https:` admits the
 * source, so the decode is one `<img>` and the encode is `toDataURL`, with no file anywhere in it.
 *
 * PNG out, as before: the caller's downscale loop measures base64 length and retries, so a format
 * that compressed differently would converge somewhere else, and the terminal paste that follows
 * assumes PNG.
 *
 * Proved in `mobile-web-app-clipboard-image-resize-render.test.mjs`, in a real browser under the
 * shipped policy against a real PNG, because a fake canvas cannot answer what a raster weighs.
