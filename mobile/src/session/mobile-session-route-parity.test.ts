// Refreshed by C7.2: five clipboard hooks joined the expanded route, which is the whole of the +5 —
// a writer in the diff-note, Markdown and selection actions, a reader in the selection actions and
// the attachment probe. The screen's other four clipboard sites (the terminal's paste, the sheets,
// the quick-command row, the diff-review send) sit outside the walk from `MobileSessionRouteScreen`
// and so do not move this pin. The copy-path sheet also gained the failure toast the other two had.
// Refreshed for `reportDictationFailure`, the whole of that +1: the composer's two dictation
// failure handlers were one policy written twice, and only `onError`'s copy knew about the setup
// sheet, so a refused start showed the desktop's own `voice_dictation_disabled` as a toast.
//
// Refreshed again for the page's keyboard: the screen's own `Keyboard.addListener` pair became the
// `useSoftKeyboard` seam, because react-native-web never fires those events and the live input row
// laid itself out under the IME. +2 hooks (the seam, and the one effect split into a visibility one
// and a height one), +1 effect, -2 registrations and -2 removals for the listener pair, and -6
// strings: the four event names and the two `'ios'` guards that chose between them. Re-recorded
// against the merged tree, since neither side's hash covers the other's change.
//
// Refreshed for the terminal fields' submit seam: react-native-web withholds `onSubmitEditing`
// when the Enter keydown reports an open composition, which is a soft keyboard's normal mid-word
// state, so both of the dock's fields also bind the page's own line-break signal. +4 hooks and +2
// callbacks in the send actions — `submitLiveInput` and `submitBufferedDraft`, each with a
// `useTerminalTextFieldSubmitBinding` beside it — and both fields moved their ref, the live one
// its submit handler too.
// Moved once more, -1 hook and -1 callback: `submitBufferedDraft` stopped being a `useCallback`.
// Memoizing it on `[]` froze the per-render `handleSend` it reads, whose guard needs a `client`
// and an `activeHandle` the first render does not have, so the page's line-break submit could
// never pass it. Found by pullfrog on #22300.
// Moved, count unchanged, when the Markdown actions' Back `useEffect` became `useBackClaim`, the
// seam that also claims the key on the page while a draft is dirty.
// Refreshed when the first subscribe began sizing itself from the document's reported cell box:
// the first-subscribe mark ref and `measureViewportOnce` are gone (hooks 282 → 280, callbacks 79 → 78).
// Again when xterm became the only cell measurer: `useTerminalCellBoxRefit` is gone, the frame's
// width ref and `handleTerminalFrameLayout` subscribe a known box on layout (hooks 282, callbacks 79),
// and the pane's `onCellBoxChange` goes to the viewport refit.
// Again when one frame ref replaced the height ref, width ref and width state (hooks 280).
// Again when one `notifyTerminalFrame` took the frame's layout (hooks 281, callbacks 80).

// Moved when the prompt-cancel flag became one structured-session host support object (main).
// Re-recorded against the merged tree. Again when the frame-layout and cell-box-change callbacks

// Pins that no callback body in the route changed unnoticed. Body text, not behaviour: the sends
// and repo reads inside them now name their `RpcOperation` instead of the raw `sendRequest` port.
// Refreshed in step 6 for the gesture flush, whose `terminal.send` became `terminalInputSend` and
// whose accepted-check became that operation's own verdict, then again when that check was spelled
// `=== true` to match the other four sites reading the same verdict. Refreshed in step 7 for the
// reply casts the checked readers made unnecessary — the markdown tab doc, the worktree record's
// `diffComments` and the browser tab's page id are typed by their schemas now. Refreshed once more
// on the merge, for the display-mode toggle whose send became `terminalDisplayModeSet`. Refreshed
// for the files domain's step 7, which retired the markdown disk fallback's `{ content, truncated,
// byteLength }` cast: the preview reader checks the content and salvages the flag, so `readMarkdownTab`
// reads `fallback.value` directly. The dictation-mode refresh is main's own body again — it forwards
// whatever mode the reply carried, so an absent one leaves the mic as inert as main left it.
// Refreshed on the merge of C7.2 and C7.3, which moved this pin from both sides: the terminal
// subscribe now carries the snapshot byte budget its transport imposes, nothing on a phone and the
// frame cap inside the shell's page, and the Markdown copy action gained the failure branch that
// answers a refused write. Re-recorded against the merged tree, since neither side's hash covers
// the other's body. The hook and string counts are C7.2's and stand.
// Refreshed once more for the two dictation failure handlers, which now both call
// `reportDictationFailure` instead of each choosing between the setup sheet and a toast.
// Moved when the metrics handler compared every field, the row pitch included (main).
// Again when the subscribe waited for web-ready and `handleTerminalWebReady` lost `documentHasInit`.
// Again when the subscribe's inits began carrying the laid-out terminal frame, and its resize too.
// Again when those grids read the one frame ref.
// Again when the subscribe sized its viewport inline instead of through a helper.
// Again when the document took the hold rule and the subscribe stopped holding its grid.
// Again when an init took one options object.
// Again when the frame's layout became one `notifyTerminalFrame`.
// Again when the init option took the message's name, `initialData`.
// Again when the document readers mapped refusal codes through one function and kept truncation.

// Refreshed for the startup effect: both `worktree.activate` sends became `worktreeActivate`, and
// the sleeping-agent check reads that operation's verdict instead of the reply envelope. Refreshed

// refusal the timer site passed when it had no reply at all. Refreshed once more for the
// last-visited-worktree effect, whose bare store write became the one writer of that key, so the
// hybrid shell's page mirror sees it as it is written rather than one `init` later. Refreshed for
// the diff-comments effect, which now catches the loader's rejection. Count unchanged.

// Six method literals fewer than before step 6: `terminal.send` and `terminal.clearBuffer` went
// first, then `worktree.activate` twice, `session.tabs.createTerminal` and
// `terminal.setDisplayMode`. Each is now fixed at its operation's definition instead of being
// spelled at the call site. Two literals more across C7.2, both of them the toast a refused write
// now shows: "Couldn't copy path" when the sheets moved onto the clipboard seam, taking the count
// from 532 to 533, and "Couldn't copy" when the Markdown copy action gained the failure branch the
// other copy paths already had, taking it to 534.
//
// Two more across C7.7, 534 -> 536: `'web'`, the platform guard the Markdown actions'
// `BackHandler` registration gained so it stops logging on the page, and `"button"`, the
// accessibility role the header's Back control gained so the page serves it by name. Neither is a
// behaviour change on a phone. The same `'web'` moves the effect hash, and `"button"` the host-JSX
// hash. The effect hash moved a second time and back: the diff-notes loader's uncaught rejection
// was caught and then reverted, because the fix moves `matrix-session.diff-notes-worktree.show-1`
// and a golden is a review event — so this hash is the one the uncaught `void` call produces.
//
// 536 -> 530 for the keyboard seam above: the four event names and the two `'ios'` guards left
// with the listener pair.
//
// The host-JSX hash moved for the header's reconnect tap, which now also checks the re-dial exists:
// the page's provider hands out none. Nothing a phone renders or does changed.
//
// 530 -> 529: `'hardwareBackPress'` left with the Markdown actions' registration for `useBackClaim`.
//
// 529 -> 530, and the host-JSX hash: `key="terminal-frame"`, so the page's frame mounts with its
// onLayout rather than reusing the loading View. Native measured 47 rows before and after: its
// frame reported either way, and its window is its frame, so both measure paths agree there.
//
// 531 -> 530, and the host-JSX and style hashes: the key left, and one `contentFrame` View wraps
// every branch and carries the frame's onLayout, so the page's frame mounts with it. The page measured
// 47 rows before and after; native was measured only on main's bundle (47), and the wrapper is a
// flex:1 View around the same flex:1 frame, so its box is the frame's.
// Count unchanged: `'frame-not-laid-out'`, the gate awaiting the frame's first layout, replaced `'measuring-viewport'`.
// 530 -> 532, and the host-JSX hash: the tab bar and the accessory bar take a ref that gives the
// page `keyboardShouldPersistTaps` ('handled', 'always'), which react-native-web ignores. Natively
// the ref is undefined. 532 -> 531: the live input's reopen flag reads the host OS, not an 'android' literal.
// 531 -> 529: the markdown status line moved to `markdownReaderStatusText`.
