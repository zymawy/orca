 *
 * Four, and each for a different target. The foundation hook bounces a deleted workspace back to
 * its host; the file-tap handlers push a preview route from a terminal link or a chat path; the
 * notification hook consumes a pane tap by rewriting this route's own params; the review route
 * body replaces to the session screen and pops the stack behind it. Only the first two and the
 * last can leave the page, which is the whole reason the third is in the list anyway — a
 * `setParams` on expo-router's router and a `setParams` on the handoff's are the same call, and
 * listing it here is what stops someone later giving it back its own `useRouter` because "it never
 * navigates".

/**
 * The expo-router names this domain may still import, and why each one is not a router.
 *
 * `useFocusEffect` reads whether this screen is the focused one in the document's own stack and
 * `useLocalSearchParams` reads the params of the route already mounted. Neither takes a target, so
 * neither can put a screen in front of the page; both are the page's own router answering about the
 * page's own route, which is exactly what it is for.
 *
 * A closed list rather than a ban on `useRouter`: the hazard is anything that navigates, and
 * expo-router exports a module-singleton `router` that does it from a plain function. A rule written
 * against the one spelling would have read that as clean.
