 * and the only policy that turns an unreadable result into a verdict instead of a throw.
 *
 * Separate from `terminalInputSend` despite the identical policy and reader: that family is the
 * query-reply responder and the live accessory, and these callers differ in what a *lost* reply
 * means. Here a drop is delivery-unknown and must not be retried, so the two keep their own names
 * and their own recorded families rather than sharing one.

 * reply contract reach the other screen.
