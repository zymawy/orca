/**
 * Every product call site that opens a host stream, and what the recording oracle can see of it.
 *
 * The raw-request-port inventory next door counts down to zero; this one does not. A subscribe is
 * not something a typed operation replaces — `RpcOperation` fixes a method, an acceptance policy
 * and a reader for one reply, and a stream has many. What this list is for is the other half of
 * the same question: which of these streams is a golden actually holding, and for the ones it is
 * not, what exactly stops it. Left as prose in a README that answer went stale twice, because
 * nothing failed when a new `client.subscribe` appeared.
 *
 * So each site is classified, and `rpc-subscription-boundary.test.ts` makes the classification
 * bind: a new site with no entry fails, an entry whose file no longer subscribes fails, an entry
 * naming the wrong method fails, and a `recorded` entry whose family is not in the scenario
 * manifest fails. A wall must name itself; "not recorded yet" and "cannot be recorded" are
 * different claims and only one of them is a backlog item.
