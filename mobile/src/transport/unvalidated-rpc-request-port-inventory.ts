/**
 * Every file that still reaches mobile's raw RPC request port, held as data.
 *
 * A reference is any direct reach for the port: a `.sendRequest` access or declaration, a
 * `'sendRequest'` selector such as `Pick<RpcClient, 'sendRequest'>`, a call to the coalescing
 * second sender `sendSingleFlightRequest`, or an import of unvalidated-rpc-request-port.ts.
 * The count is per file and is a ceiling, not a target: unvalidated-rpc-request-port-boundary.test.ts
 * fails on a file that is not listed, on a listed file that no longer reaches the port, and on a
 * listed file whose count went up. Both lists only shrink.
 *
 * The owners are permanent — they implement, route or validate the port. The pending list is the
 * step-4 migration backlog and shares one reason, stated once here instead of 144 times:
 * the call site predates the typed contract and still picks its own method string, its own
 * acceptance rule and its own decoding. Replacing one with an RpcOperation deletes its line.
 *
 * Where a group below names a blocker, it is a recording blocker, not a migration blocker.
 * Pointing a site at an operation is mechanical; the golden recorded against the old code before
 * the refactor is the only parity proof this migration has. So a site the recorder cannot mount
 * cannot be recorded, and unrecorded sites do not migrate.

  // store and the notification tray, not a credential, so `loadHosts()` answers with an empty list
  // and the screen has no client. `notifications.testPush` migrated because its screen reads

  // reply envelope instead of off its result, so the value is always undefined; that is a product
  // defect with its own fix and re-record, not something this migration may quietly repair.

  // both of them read. See new-workspace-operations.ts,

  // in tasks/mobile-workspace-source-operations.ts, and the repo.list readers the dialog now shares

  // pinning a device input.

  // reconciliation followed once a scenario could declare the notification tray and the stored host
  // list it resolves against; see push-dismissal-operations.ts. The stream unsubscribe inside the

  // the diff-review loaders and the rest of the screen migrated in step 4; see
  // mobile-session-{read,write,launch}-operations.ts, mobile-clipboard-image-operations.ts and
  // mobile-diff-review-git-operations.ts. The terminal input surface followed: the composed send,
  // the live keystroke send, the clipboard paste and — in step 6 — the gesture flush all send
  // through terminal.input-send in terminal/mobile-terminal-operations.ts, the menu's clear goes
  // through terminal.clear-buffer-or-skip beside it, and the accessory's connection lookup reads
  // the repo list through the new-tab operation. Step 6 also took the two requests that share an
  // effect with a subscribe: the header's live title (worktree.show-record-or-skip) and native
  // chat's older-history page (nativeChat.read-session-page-or-skip), both in
  // mobile-session-read-operations.ts. Step 6's second migration took the last three hooks that
  // were listed here as blocked on a WebView-ref substitute: none of them imports the terminal
  // WebView, and all three sent with no ref at all. The startup effect's two `worktree.activate`
  // sends now reuse host-screen's `worktreeActivate`, and the New Tab create and the terminal
  // menu's display-mode toggle go through session.tabs-create-terminal and
  // terminal.set-display-mode-or-skip in mobile-session-write-operations.ts.
