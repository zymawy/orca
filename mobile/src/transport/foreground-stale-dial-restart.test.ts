// after i navigated out of the app and back it doesn't work anymore. Now i went
// back again it's connected now."
//
// The tell is that the SECOND foreground fixed it. notifyForeground only ever
// acted on 'connected' (probe the socket) and 'reconnecting' (redial now). A
// phone that is suspended mid-dial resumes in 'connecting'/'handshaking', where
// the nudge did nothing: the user waited out the remainder of the 12s connect
// budget on a socket opened over a network path that no longer existed, and
// then the *preserved* backoff delay — up to 60s of "Connecting…" against a
// desktop that was answering the whole time. By the next foreground the client
// had landed in 'reconnecting', where the nudge works, so it connected at once.
