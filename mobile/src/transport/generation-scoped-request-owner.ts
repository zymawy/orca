/**
 * Owns the cache, the in-flight identity and the generation token for one family of requests, so a
 * reply that outlived its scope has nowhere to land.
 *
 * The fence is structural rather than a callback a caller may forget. `read` and `load` are handed
 * the scope and build the key themselves, and a scope the owner has not seen retires everything it
 * held before it answers. A reply is published only through `commit`, which refuses a lease whose
 * generation has moved; a commit that beat the owner's own notice still cannot be read, because the
 * next read syncs first. What `committed` does not say is that the value in the caller's own hand is
 * fresh: a caller that displays it directly still needs whatever fences its display, which for the
 * file-search pilot is the sequence counter it already had.
 *
 * Three epochs may appear in a scope and they are not the same thing: the logical authority epoch
 * (`StableLogicalRpcClient.getGeneration`, advanced by `migrateTo`), the physical authenticated
 * session (`authenticationGeneration` inside `direct-rpc-client.ts`) and the negotiated capability
 * epoch. Which of them retires a given owner's data is that owner's decision, made by what its
 * callers put in the scope.
