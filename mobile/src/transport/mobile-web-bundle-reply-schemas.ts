 *  reason to refuse a bundle, it is a reason to leave that one route native.
 *
 *  `optionalGrants` is read so this build can honour it, and typed here only — the host's own
 *  schema is where its grammar and the ceiling over the union live. A shell without this line still
 *  receives the key, because loose passes unknown members through rather than stripping them; what
 *  such a shell lacks is a policy that reads it, so it serves the route on `grants` alone. The
