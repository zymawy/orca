 * first because a host without a bundle has no manifest to disagree about, and the schema answer
 * comes before the protocol window because an unknown schema makes the numbers in it unreadable.
 *
 * Same `?? 0` defaults as `evaluateCompat`, and they are not symmetric. An absent
 * `protocolVersion` is the oldest host that could have answered, so it never reads as permission.
 * An absent `minCompatibleMobileVersion` is fail-open by design: a host that declares no floor for
 * the bundle it serves does not get one guessed at, and the desktop-side check above is what still
 * catches a host too old for that bundle.
