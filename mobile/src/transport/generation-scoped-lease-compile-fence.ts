// Why this file exists: the owner's claim is that a caller cannot publish into it except through a
// lease it issued, in the generation it issued it. Every expect-error directive below is that claim
// as an assertion — tsc fails on a directive that stops catching an error, so
// `pnpm --dir mobile typecheck` is the gate. `mobile/tsconfig.json` excludes tests, so a type-level
// assertion written in one is checked by nothing; that is why these live here. Nothing here runs.
