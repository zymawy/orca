/**
 * Which of the app's stored keys the page may read and write, and how much of each.
 *
 * AsyncStorage's web build is `window.localStorage`, which the page does not have: Android turns
 * DOM storage off and on iOS the origin host is the session id, so anything written there is empty
 * again on the next remount. A pin that silently forgets itself is worse than one that cannot be
 * set, so the page's store is the app's, reached over the `storage` grant.
 *
 * An allowlist and not a passthrough. Everything the app keeps under `orca:` is in one namespace —
 * push registrations, the hybrid shell flag itself — and a page that could write any of them could
 * turn the feature on for a build that never offered it. A prefix is listed only where the key
 * carries an id the desktop chooses; the rest are exact.
 *
 * Every key here was read off a page route's own closure rather than taken from a list: a key a
 * screen reads and this file does not name is a preference that silently falls back to its default
 * inside the page and keeps working outside it, which is the failure the grant exists to end
 * (rulings-ota-c7.md ruling 7).
