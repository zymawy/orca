 * merely intended is a download that keeps four of the host's read slots and a cache write that
 * lands under a host nobody is looking at any more.
 *
 * The React Native and Expo modules are mocked at the edge of the import graph rather than stubbed
 * one deep, because importing any of them pulls the runtime this test does not have.
