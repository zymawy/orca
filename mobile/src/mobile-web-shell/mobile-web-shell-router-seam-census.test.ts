 * different — it holds the app end of the seam as well, so the rule cannot be "no router" and has
 * to name which modules are the app end.
 *
 * It is also the tree where the gap showed: `PageRouteUnavailableScreen` shipped with a bare
 * `useRouter` and nothing caught it, because the three landed censuses walk `src/session`,

 * `navigate` notify arrives at, so routing it through the seam would hand the page's target back to
 * the page. `useShellStackPop` is the same for `onNavigateBack`: it pops the native stack the shell
 * was pushed onto. Neither has a `.web.*` sibling and neither can run inside the page — the page has
