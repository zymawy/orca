 * How long a staged file survives with nothing reading it.

 * The read itself is nowhere near this. The largest item a pick may stage is
 * `CLIPBOARD_IMAGE_MAX_SOURCE_BYTES`, which at `BRIDGE_MEDIA_READ_MAX_BYTES` a chunk is
 * 48 round trips over a `postMessage` that measures in fractions of a millisecond. The TTL is not
 * sized for that: it is sized for the page that picked and then stopped — the user who backgrounded
 * the app mid-composer, the document that faulted before its first chunk — where nothing will ever
 * call `release` and the only other sweep is the session's own end. Five minutes is three orders of
 * magnitude above the read and short enough that an abandoned pick does not outlive the screen it
 * was made on.
 *
 * Measured from the last touch, not from the mint: a page reading a large file one chunk at a time
 * must not have the file swept out from under it halfway through.
