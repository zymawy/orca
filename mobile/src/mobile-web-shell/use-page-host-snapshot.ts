 * a page-side write is gone on the next remount. Both cross in `init` instead.
 *
 * The profile is read once per mount, because a host's identity does not change under one. The
 * keys are re-seated per `init` answer, because the store is their truth; between those reads the
 * map is kept current by every writer of one, which is what lets `init` stay synchronous.
