/**
 * Which renderer a hybrid-shell route switch mounts, once that is knowable.
 *
 * `pending` is the third answer every switch was missing. Where the flag can be on it is read from
 * storage after the first render, so `null` is a window every switch passes through, and each one
 * used to spend it on the native screen: a flag-on user watched the native screen mount, subscribe
 * and paint, then be torn down and replaced by the page. One decision here so a switch cannot hold
 * a private opinion about `null`, and so the flag keeps exactly one reader — which is what makes
 * the census beside this file total rather than a list somebody remembers to extend.
 *
 * `pending` is unreachable on a build that cannot have the flag on: the hook starts at `false`
 * there, so a store build commits its native renderer on frame one and pays nothing for a neutral
 * state it could never have used.
 *
 * A route the shell could never open is answered `native` without waiting: the flag cannot change
 * that outcome, and a neutral frame in front of a decided one is a flash this file exists to remove.
