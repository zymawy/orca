/**
 * What a host-scoped pathname nothing can paint lands on.
 *
 * The catch-all route is the one switch with no native screen behind it, so its `fallback` cannot
 * be a panel: a pathname the bundle does not list, or lists needing a grant this app lacks, has no
 * renderer on either side. This replaces expo-router's Unmatched there, which says "Unmatched
 * Route" and offers a sitemap link that means nothing to someone holding a stale app.
 *
 * `replace` and not `push`: this screen is a dead end, so leaving it must not leave it behind to
 * come back to.
 *
 * Through `hostStackHostRoute` rather than a template: an id carrying `/` builds a two-segment
 * pathname, and `/h/a/b` is caught by the very route that rendered this, with `hostId` now `a`.
 *
 * An absent id has no host route to return to. `firstParam` answers `''`, and `/h/` matches no
 * screen at all — measured with expo-router's own matcher, it resolves to the `h` layout with no
 * child — so the way out is the app root, which is where `ProtocolBlockScreen` sends the same
 * gesture from the same position. The label follows the target rather than outliving it.
 *
 * `useRouteHandoff` and not `useRouter`: the page renders this screen too, through the catch-all's
 * `.web.tsx` sibling, and there a bare replace navigates inside the WebView to a route the page
 * does not carry instead of leaving it. The seam posts the target to the shell.
