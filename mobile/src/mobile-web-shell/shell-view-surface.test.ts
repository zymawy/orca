/**
 * What the WebView paints before its document does, read off both shells.
 *
 * Neither can be proven from a JVM or a Swift unit test: it is a property of a live view. What is
 * checkable is that neither shell gives the view a surface of its own, which is what makes the
 * frame behind it — the screen's own, in the app's own colours — the thing on screen.
 *
 * The two defaults differ and both are wrong. Android's WebView paints nothing under a transparent
 * background, which is fine; a WKWebView is opaque by default and paints white, so a dark app
 * opening a page flashed white for the whole of the page's boot.
