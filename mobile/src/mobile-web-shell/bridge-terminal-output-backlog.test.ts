/**
 * A terminal stream against a page that reads slower than the host writes, which is every terminal.
 *
 * The byte window ends a stream when the page falls 4 MiB behind. For a terminal that is not a page
 * that went wrong: C7's design measured the host producing 70.3 MiB/s of JSON while real xterm in a
 * browser applies 2.2 MiB/s, so an ordinary 5 MB `cat` crosses the window in 62 ms and the pane
 * dies before it has painted anything.
 *
 * The timelines below are rebuilt from that design's measured parameters rather than replayed from
 * its capture files, which this lane does not carry: the host's batcher flushes at 64 KiB or 5 ms
 * and `iterateTerminalOutputFrameChunks` splits at 48 KiB, so the frame sizes are the ones those
 * two rules produce, and the JSON expansion is measured here on the bytes rather than assumed —
 * plain output escapes little, and `grep --color` is SGR sequences whose ESC bytes cost six each.
