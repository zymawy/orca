 * host acted on a frame it had never granted — a new member of the notify union was a silent hole
 * rather than a compile error. `Record<BridgeNotifyName, …>` makes the omission a TS2741 here.
 *
 * Name and grant are separate columns because they are not always the same word: `navigate-back` is
 * the second verb of `navigate`, so an app that implements navigation implements both and nothing
 * new enters `MOBILE_WEB_SHELL_GRANTS`. Keyed on the notify name alone it would be refused by every
 * shell that exists.
 *
 * `foreground` and `terminalViewport` are the protocol's own and ride no grant. The other five are
 * inert while every page is offered all of them, and load-bearing the moment a grant is per-route.
 *
 * Haptics is the second whose name is not its grant, and for a different reason from
 * `navigate-back`: every grant in this table is a token because a notify is not a verb, and the
 * dotted names in `MOBILE_WEB_SHELL_GRANTS` come from the verb table alone.
