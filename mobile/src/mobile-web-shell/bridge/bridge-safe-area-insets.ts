 * The shell lays the WebView out edge-to-edge like a native screen, so the page pads for the bars
 * the way native screens do: through react-native-safe-area-context. The web provider cannot
 * measure them (`env(safe-area-inset-*)` reads 0 in both WebViews), so the shell says them in
 * `init`. Optional and additive: absent reads as zeros, which is the old shell that reserved the
 * strips outside the view itself.
