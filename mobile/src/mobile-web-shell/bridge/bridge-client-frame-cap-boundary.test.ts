/**
 * The page refuses exactly what the shell's reader refuses, at the boundary and by construction.
 *
 * The page holds its own copy of the reader's cap so a caller hears `oversized` rather than waiting
 * for a reply the shell will never send. That only works while the two agree to the byte: a sender
 * one unit more generous posts a frame the reader drops, and the hang the refusal exists to end
 * comes back for frames in that one-unit band.
 *
 * Two rules, because either alone passes against the defect. The boundary cases say the sender and
 * the reader answer the same way at `cap` and at `cap + 1`, which reds on an off-by-one. The census
 * says the client reaches the cap through the shared predicate and names no second spelling of it,
 * which reds on a copy that happens to be correct today.
