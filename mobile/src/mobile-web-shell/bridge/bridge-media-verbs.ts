/**
 * The wire shapes of `native.media.pick`, `native.media.read` and `native.media.release`.
 *
 * A picked image is up to `CLIPBOARD_IMAGE_MAX_SOURCE_BYTES` of raw bytes: twenty-eight times the
 * frame cap, and two and a quarter times the reply ceiling before anything encodes it. Base64 is
 * what makes that three times the ceiling, which is a different basis and is why both are named.
 * Either way the value never crosses as a value. `pick` answers a handle the shell owns, `read`
 * moves the bytes a chunk at a time, and `release` ends it. Split from `bridge-native-verbs.ts`
 * because these three are one contract of their own and that module is the table every verb is
 * listed in.
 *
 * The verb is `read` and not `readChunk` for a reason a rename cannot be undone from: a manifest
 * grant name is held to `native(?:\.[a-z][a-z0-9]*){2,}`, and `bundled-mobile-web-bundle.ts`
 * parses the manifest whole, so one camel-cased segment is not a route that falls back to native —
 * it is a bundle the phone refuses entire.

/**
 * Where the bytes come from. `clipboard` is a source here rather than a fourth verb, which is what

 * read in chunks like any other, instead of being widened into an inline value the caps refuse.
