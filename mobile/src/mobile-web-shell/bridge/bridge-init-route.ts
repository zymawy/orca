/**
 * Which screen the shell opened this page for.
 *
 * Additive, and optional where it is read for that reason: a shell built before C1.2 sends no
 * `route`, and the page says so rather than painting expo-router's Unmatched screen. It has to
 * cross, because the document is served at `/` and refuses every other path, so the page's own
 * location matches no route in the tree it carries and there is nothing else to derive it from.
 *
 * `params` is the search half, kept out of `pathname` so neither side has to parse a URL: the page
 * builds one, once, and writes it into its history before the first render.
 *
 * Its own module rather than the envelope's, because three other modules want the route without
 * the rest of the protocol: the native switches build one, the host holds one and republishes it
 * (ruling 33.1), and the page reads one back out of `init`.
