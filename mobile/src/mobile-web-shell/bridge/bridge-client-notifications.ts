/**
 * Everything the page posts and hears nothing back about.
 *
 * Seven of the eight post through one guard, but only three reach its throw, and it is not the guard
 * `sendRequest` uses. A call before `init` is a mount-order bug and throws; a call after `close` is
 * an unmounting screen posting one more nudge on its way out, which the native clients answer
 * inertly rather than by throwing into a teardown path nobody wrote a catch for. Nothing here
 * returns a promise, so nothing here can be awaited into a rejection either.
 *
 * Only the three ungated notifies reach that throw. A grant is read off the session, so before `init`
 * there is no grant either and `navigate`, `navigate-back`, `externalLink`, `storage` and the
 * haptic answer false without asking: that is the same false they answer a shell that withheld the
 * grant, and every caller already handles it — `useRouteHandoff` pushes or goes back inside the
 * page instead, where a throw would take down a tap handler nobody wrapped.
 *
 * `notifyPageFault` reads the session instead of requiring it for a different reason: its one caller
 * is an error boundary, and a report that threw would replace the page's last word with an error
 * nobody catches.
