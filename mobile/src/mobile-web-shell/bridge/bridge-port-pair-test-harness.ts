/**
 * The page and the shell wired to each other through the weakest transport that is still a
 * transport, so a test of either one is a test of the pair.
 *
 * Two properties are the whole point. One FIFO per direction, because the payloads a shell client
 * publishes are published in delivery order, so a lane that let a `subscribe` pass a `sendRequest`
 * would move the recorder's shared ordinal and manufacture the reorder `write-ordinal.ts` exists to
 * catch. And delivery on a microtask, the weakest async the golden runner's zero-time drains flush
 * and the only one that moves no virtual millisecond.
 *
 * The shell client is a type parameter because the golden recorder puts its own scripted client
 * behind this pair; `createFakeBridgePortPair` is the shape every other test wants.
