 * for it to be cleared, naming the value it applied. Nothing tracks delivery on either side, and
 * the shell learns nothing from a post: a frame the page received and then failed to handle is the
 * page's own failure, reported there, and a post is refused only when no document holds the view.
 * Every one of those is followed by a fresh document's `ready`, answered with the route the shell
 * holds then. A clear naming a pane the tap has already moved past is refused by the comparison
 * rather than by a sequence number.
