 * there, and this is not a verb — nothing is requested and answered, the shell simply encodes
 * frames a stream is already producing.
 *
 * It exists as a grant rather than as a property of the stream because it is the only thing that
 * tells a page a shell can carry those frames at all. An app built before C6.1 parses a manifest
 * naming it, finds nothing behind it, and leaves the route native rather than mounting a pane that
 * would subscribe and wait for frames that cannot come.

 * session was granted it, because grants are per route: without this any route's page could ask for
 * a lane its route never declared, which is the hole per-route grants exist to close.
 *
 * Ungranted is not a refusal on the wire. The subscription proceeds and its JSON events cross as
 * they always have — the same silence every other grant gives at the call site, and a state a page
 * that reads its own `init.grants.native` never reaches. It is named apart from `not-asked` so the
 * host can say so locally: nothing crosses back, so without a diagnostic a page that did ask gets
 * JSON for the life of the document with no side able to say why.
