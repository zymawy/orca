/**
 * The shell-answered request seam: what a `native.` method is, and every verb there is.
 *
 * A page `request` whose method starts with this prefix is answered by the host and never reaches
 * the desktop. That fence is the load-bearing one. The desktop would refuse the method too — it is
 * absent from `MOBILE_RPC_METHOD_ALLOWLIST`, which answers `forbidden` for anything unlisted — but
 * that only applies to a request that got as far as a paired desktop, and depends on its version.
 * The point of the prefix is that the request never leaves the phone, so neither matters.
 *
 * Replies ride the existing `reply` and `error` frames and count against the same in-flight cap as
 * a forwarded request. They carry **no `_meta`**: `isRpcResponse` does not require it on either
 * arm, and no runtime produced these, so a page reader must not depend on one being there.
 *
 * Adding a verb is a row here plus a handler; it is never a new frame kind.
