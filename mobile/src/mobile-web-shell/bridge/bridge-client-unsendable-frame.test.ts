/**
 * A frame the page cannot serialize, which is a send that failed and not an exception.
 *
 * `sendFrame` never throws, and every caller below it depends on that: `sendRequest` opens the id
 * before it posts and abandons it on the way out, so a throw escaping the post skips the abandon and
 * holds one of sixty-four in-flight slots for the life of the page. Sixty-four such calls and the
 * client refuses every request afterwards with nothing on screen to say why.
 *
 * Measured on this tree with serialization outside the `try`: one cyclic `params` left 63 of the 64
 * slots usable, raised no diagnostic at all, and rejected the caller with a bare `TypeError` from
 * `JSON.stringify` rather than the send failure the contract names. The cases below are that
 * difference, and they red on the serialization moving back out.
 *
 * `params` is the surface, not a hypothetical: every value in a page frame is one a screen handed
 * in, and a cycle, a `BigInt` or a throwing `toJSON` all reach here the same way.
