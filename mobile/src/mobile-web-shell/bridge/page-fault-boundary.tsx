 * The one boundary the page mounts, directly under its root and above the router.

 * It renders nothing on a fault and offers nothing to press. That is the whole design: the
 * generation this page came from is on disk and was hash-checked before the view loaded it, so the
 * same bytes throw again and a retry here would only throw twice. Recovery belongs to the shell,
 * which hears the report and drops the generation, and until it acts the page showing nothing is
 * honest about what it can do.
 *
 * Above the router rather than inside it, because a route that cannot be resolved or imported
 * throws where the router renders it and a boundary below that would never see it. What it cannot
 * see either way is a throw from an event handler or a rejected promise with no render behind it;
 * React reports neither to a boundary, and the shell's own load state is what covers those.
