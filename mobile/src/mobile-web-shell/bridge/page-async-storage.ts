 * turns DOM storage off, and on iOS the origin host is the session id, so every remount starts
 * empty. A pin that silently forgets itself is worse than one that cannot be set, so this holds the
 * app's own values instead: `init` primes them, a write is applied here and posted, and the app is
 * where it lands.
 *
 * Reads are synchronous against that cache behind an async surface, which is what the real module
 * is too. Nothing here waits on the shell: a write the shell drops is a write the next `init`
 * corrects, and a read that waited for a round trip would change what the first render sees.

 * Android — so rejecting is the module's own contract for a value too big, and the caller that
 * needs it is written for it: the durable send journal, whose composer catches this and answers
 * "Message not sent" rather than sending a mutation whose operation id was never written down
 * (ruling 7).
 *
 * The other two refusals stay silent drops, because nothing catches them. A page-closure writer of
 * an unlisted key calls `setItem` and awaits it with no catch —
 * `notification-delivery-preferences.ts:39` is the plain case, and `preferences.ts` has several —
 * so rejecting there converts a preference the page was never allowed to keep into an unhandled
 * rejection in the document. A write nobody may make and a write the shell would not take are both
 * the page failing to change anything, which is what it already does; the log is where they go.
