 * same 64-deep in-flight window a forwarded request spends, and there are 90 call sites in this
 * app, some of them one per row of a scrolling list. Nothing is owed back — a haptic the shell did
 * not play is a tap that felt like every tap on every phone before this page existed.
 *
 * Split out of `bridge-envelope.ts` rather than added to it, as `bridge-event-envelope-bytes.ts`
 * was: that file is the protocol's schemas and it is at its line cap. The arm below is its fields
 * without `v`, because the envelope owns the version literal and reading it back from here would be
 * an import cycle.
