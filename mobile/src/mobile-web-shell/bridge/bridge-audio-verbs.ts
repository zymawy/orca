 * The wire shapes of `native.audio.start`, `native.audio.read` and `native.audio.stop`.
 *
 * Dictation is the page's, and the microphone is the shell's. The page holds the state machine the
 * composer renders and speaks `speech.dictation.*` to the desktop, so the only thing that has to
 * cross is the capability: raw PCM. The screen the microphone holds awake does not cross at all —
 * it is a property of the capture, taken and given back on the device side. That is why audio is
 * pulled rather than pushed. The `request`/`reply` table is the only page-facing seam the shell
 * has, the one shell-to-page push there is belongs to an RPC `subscribe`, and a push lane for bytes
 * the page immediately hands back would be a new frame kind for no gain.
 *
 * So the shell rings what the microphone produces and the page drains it. The ring is exactly the
 * page's own pending-audio budget: the page already refuses to hold more unsent audio than that,
 * so a second, different bound would be a second answer to the same question.
 *
 * The verbs are `audio.start|read|stop`, never `audio.readChunk`: a manifest grant name is held to
 * `native(?:\.[a-z][a-z0-9]*){2,}` by `GRANT_NAME_PATTERN`, and `bundled-mobile-web-bundle.ts`
 * parses the manifest whole, so one camel-cased segment is a bundle the phone refuses entire.
