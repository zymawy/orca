 * The shell's half of the device Back key: taken from the navigator while the page is holding it,
 * and given straight back when it is not.
 *
 * Two platforms, two mechanisms, one claim. Android has a hardware key, so the press is intercepted
 * and posted; iOS has none, so what is taken away is the stack's swipe-back gesture — a swipe while
 * a sheet is open would leave the screen with the sheet still on it.
 *
 * Nothing is registered without a live claim, so a page holding nothing, a shell whose page has
 * faulted, and a session between documents all keep today's behaviour: the navigator pops.
