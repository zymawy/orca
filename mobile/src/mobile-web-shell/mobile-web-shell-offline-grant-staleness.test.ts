/**
 * The whole of finding 7 on #21503, end to end and against a disk.
 *
 * A route-grant edit on the desktop moves no asset, so the bundle keeps its build id: the phone
 * holds the right bytes under a manifest an edit behind, and that stored manifest is the only
 * evidence an offline entry has. Every other suite here stops at one of the seams — the reducer's
 * effect list, or the store handed a manifest by a test — so none of them can tell whether the
 * effect the reducer emits reaches the file the next cold start reads.
 *
 * So this one mounts the real hook over the real store over an in-memory disk, and the only doubles
 * are the network and the platform modules the runtime cannot load under vitest. What it measures
 * is the offline verdict of a second mount that shares nothing with the first but the tree on disk.
