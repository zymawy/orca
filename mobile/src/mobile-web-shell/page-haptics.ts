 * A haptic the page asked for, played by the same functions a native screen plays.
 *
 * The native file's own bodies and nothing beside them: the `Platform.OS` split, the Android
 * `HapticFeedbackConstants` and the iOS styles all stay where they are, so a phone feels the same
 * tap whether the screen came from the bundle or from the app. A second mapping would be the one
 * that drifted.
 *
 * Total in both the directions a type can state. Keyed on the kind union, a kind with no row does
 * not compile; named as imports rather than reached through a namespace, a row naming a function
 * `haptics.ts` does not export does not compile either. The third direction — a haptic that file
 * grows with no kind of its own, which the page could never ask for — is the census's, in
 * `config/scripts/mobile-web-app-haptics-seam.test.mjs`, which reads both files' names.
