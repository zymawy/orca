 * What a route switch paints while the hybrid shell flag is still being read, which is a

 *
 * The base background and nothing else placed on it, so the frame before the decision looks like
 * the frame after it whichever way the decision goes. Lifted out of the `web` route, which is
 * where this exact view already was, rather than written again: it is `HostProtocolGate`'s pending
 * state to the pixel, which is the surface directly above every switch that uses this one.
