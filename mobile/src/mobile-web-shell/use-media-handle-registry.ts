 * and the files would sit in the cache until the OS reclaimed them. The cleanup covers the unmount
 * for the same reason — a swipe away from the screen is the commonest way a pick is abandoned.
 *
 * `discard` is read through a ref so a caller's fresh closure each render cannot rebuild the
 * registry and sweep files a live page is still reading.
