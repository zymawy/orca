 *
 * Its own module because the route stopped being a constant (ruling 33.1): a notification tap for
 * another pane of the session on screen rewrites one param of a page that is already mounted, and
 * what the host may do about that is a decision with four inputs rather than a field. It holds no
 * more than that (ruling 34): what the page has received is the page's business, and the only
 * thing here that outlives a call is the route the shell is on.
