/**
 * Why this manifest may not be written onto the generation on disk, or null when it may.
 *
 * The asset list, not just the id: the build id is a digest of exactly that list, so a manifest
 * claiming the id while naming other bytes is a different bundle however it arrived, and writing it
 * would leave a cached generation described by a manifest its own files do not answer. Compared
 * through the contract's own serializer, which is the string the id is computed from, so the two
 * cannot disagree about what counts as the same assets.
 *
 * The second reading of one rule, not a second rule. Both schemas now pin `buildId` to
 * `computeMobileWebBundleId(assets)` — the host's `.strict()` one in
 * `src/shared/mobile-web-bundle/manifest-contract.ts`, and the phone's loose reader in
 * `mobile-web-bundle-reply-schemas.ts` — so a manifest that arrived through either parse already
 * names the list its id digests. It is read again here because the argument is a plain object:
 * nothing in the type says which parse, if any, it came from, and this is the last code before a
 * write onto bytes a phone with no host has nothing else to fall back on.
