/**
 * The hybrid shell flag is the whole of what keeps this feature dark in a native build, so who
 * touches it is a product invariant rather than a convention. A second reader is how a dark feature
 * stops being dark: a launch-time sweep, a prefetch or a menu item that consults the flag would run
 * in a native store build the moment anything flipped it, and none of those would fail a type
 * check.
 *
 * The build-kind fact is the same shape of invariant one level up. `EXPO_PUBLIC_MOBILE_SHELL` is
 * what a release workflow sets to build the OTA binary, and a second module spelling it would be a
 * second answer to "is this the page's build" that no type check would catch either.
