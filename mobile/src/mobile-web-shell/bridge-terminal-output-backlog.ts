/**
 * What the shell does with terminal output the page has not caught up with.
 *
 * Every other stream has a backpressure window and ends when the page falls behind it, which is
 * right for a stream whose reader can survive a gap. A terminal's cannot: a missing chunk is
 * invisible in a transcript, so the choice is between holding the bytes and killing the pane, and
 * the window as it stands kills it under an ordinary `cat`. Measured on this lane's fixtures the
 * host produces 70.3 MiB/s of JSON while real xterm applies 2.2 MiB/s, so a 4 MiB window closes in
 * 62 ms — before the first frame is painted, not after a page has gone wrong.
 *
 * So output is held, merged, and delivered as the page acks, and the stream ends only on the two
 * things that are not slowness: a page that has stopped answering at all, and a backlog past what
 * this process can hold.
 */

 * How long the page may ack nothing before the stream is called dead.

 * that, which is the difference between a page that is slow — a big paste, a backgrounded tab, a
 * GC pause — and one that is not running. Below that margin the rule would end streams that were
