 * of delegation. `cancel` and `ack` come with it so all three stream frames are decided in one
 * place, and the host's `cancel` arm still chooses between a stream and a request where it always
 * did — a page's `cancel` names one or the other and splitting that choice would put half an arm
 * in each module.
 *
 * `requests` is narrowed to the one question asked of it: an id already in flight as a request is
 * not available to a stream.
