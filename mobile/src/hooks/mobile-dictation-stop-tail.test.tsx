/**
 * The ordering `stop()` depends on: the capture hands over its tail, and only then does the flow
 * stop accepting chunks.
 *
 * On the page the tail is real audio — up to one drain interval of what the user was still saying
 * as they lifted the button, fetched by the last read inside `end()`. Refusing chunks first drops
 * exactly that, and taking the pending set before it lets `finish` overtake the last send. Neither
 * shows up in a source-text check: both orders put `end()` before `Promise.allSettled`, and
 * reversing the two lines left the whole mobile suite green.
 *
 * Driven against a capture whose `end()` delivers a chunk, which is what the page's seam does and
 * what the device's never does, so this is the one case that can tell the orders apart.
