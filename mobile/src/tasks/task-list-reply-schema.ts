 * compares `connected` to `true`, :64 reads `workspaces ?? []`, and :66 walks
 * `selectedWorkspaceId ?? activeWorkspaceId ?? workspaces[0]?.id ?? null`. Main read those members
 * off `null` and threw a property-read TypeError the Tasks screen showed as its load error.
 *
 * `selectedWorkspaceId` keeps an explicit `null`, which is a value this host sends
 * (src/main/linear/client.ts:180) and which the `??` chain at the call site is what interprets.
 *
 * The workspace row is mobile's own `LinearWorkspace` (mobile-tasks-view-state-types.ts:63), not
 * the host's: the picker reads `workspace.id` as its value and match key and
 * `organizationName ?? displayName ?? id` as its label
 * (use-mobile-tasks-provider-view-projection.tsx:76-86), and nothing on this screen reads the rest
 * of what `getStatus` sends. A row without an `id` drops, because it can neither be selected nor
 * matched.
