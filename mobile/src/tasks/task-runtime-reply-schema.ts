// Checked against src/main/runtime/rpc/methods/status.ts:6-16 (RuntimeStatus, declared in
// src/shared/runtime-session-contracts.ts:64), client-ui.ts:22-74 (the `{ settings }` / `{ ui }`

/**
 * The runtime status, read for a capability list and nothing else.
 *
 * `capabilities` is the only member any consumer here reaches for, and every one of them guards it
 * — `status.capabilities?.includes(…)` in use-mobile-tasks-runtime-hydration.tsx:205 and in
 * src/shared/file-mutation-ownership.ts:10, `result.capabilities ?? []` in
 * worktree-create-capability.ts:51. So the requirement is the container: main read `.capabilities`
 * off whatever the payload was, and a string or a number reply was a property read that answered
 * `undefined` and silently downgraded the host to "Tasks unsupported".
 *
 * Elements are strings and a non-string element drops. `includes` over a mixed array already never
 * matched a capability id, so the drop changes no verdict; it is what makes the drop visible in
 * the salvage report instead of invisible in an `includes` that quietly answers false.
 *
 * `worktreeCreateIdempotency` is `unknown` on purpose. worktree-create-capability.ts:55-70 does its
 * own `typeof`/`Array.isArray` triage over it and treats absent, null, non-object and object as
 * four different answers; a schema that narrowed it would have to pick one of those apart here and
 * change which branch a host lands in.

/**
 * Persisted client UI state, answered under a `ui` member.
 *
 * The reader yields `ui` itself, which is what the member reader it replaces did, and it is total
 * like the two probes below it. Main's `rpcPayloadMember` boxed the payload and read `undefined`
 * off a string, a number or an array, so the Tasks screen hydrated on any of those; a refusal here
 * would instead throw out of `hydrateTaskState` and leave the whole screen unhydrated (the outer
 * `.catch` at use-mobile-tasks-runtime-hydration.tsx:349). Main did throw on a null or absent
 * payload, and that is the one place this reader is deliberately kinder: persisted UI state is
 * optional at every read (:283 spells `uiState?.trustedOrcaHooks ?? {}`, :284
 * `uiState?.taskResumeState ?? {}`), so "no ui" hydrates with the defaults rather than failing the
 * settings, preflight and Linear legs that arrived beside it. The
 * `matrix-settings.task-hydration-ui.get-1` golden records that move on `result-absent` and
 * `result-null`.
 *
 * Both members are `unknown`, and the call site keeps one narrowing cast over them. They are
 * opaque forwards: `trustedOrcaHooks` goes straight into state, and `taskResumeState` is the
 * screen's whole persisted view state, re-read field by field with its own defaults at :286 and
 * across use-mobile-tasks-client-settings-actions.tsx. Declaring either here would restate a
 * twelve-member union that nothing in this reader reads.

 * envelope whose `result` is absent or null and then asks the reader to decode it, and a refusal
 * there throws out of the whole hydration -- the corpus records main hydrating the Tasks screen on
