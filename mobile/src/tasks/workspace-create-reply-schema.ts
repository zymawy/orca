 * `/session/${result.worktree.id}` and :266 reads `result.worktree.displayName`, neither guarded,
 * so a reply without the record navigated the phone to `/session/undefined`. Every recorded create
 * carries it — `tw-create-retry-created`, `tw-create-retry-warning-kept`,
 * `settings-task-workspace-create-linear` and its pr-start-point sibling.
 *
 * `z.string()` and not `.min(1)`: worktree-create-retry.ts:158 rejects an empty id itself and
 * answers "Failed to create workspace", and that arm stays reachable rather than becoming a decode
 * failure.
 *
 * `warning` is optional and untrimmed. Both readers trim it themselves (:268 and
 * worktree-create-retry.ts:169), and `tw-create-retry-warning-kept` records the host sending
 * `"  startup terminal failed  "` — normalising it here would move that golden.

 * worktree-create-retry.ts:123 turns into "Failed to create workspace". That arm is preserved.
 *
 * What the container adds is the reply main could not name: a string, a number or `null` receipt
 * reached the same "Failed to create workspace" copy as a receipt that simply had no id, so a host
 * answering the wrong shape was indistinguishable from one that could not create.
