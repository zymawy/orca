 * A Linear issue list, in either shape the picker has always accepted.

 * reader in linear-mobile-issue-read.ts, whose `throw new Error('Unexpected Linear tasks
 * response')` reached the screen as its own copy; the same payloads are now named as an
 * incompatible `linear.searchIssues` / `linear.listIssues` reply.
 *
 * The row is `linearIssueRowSchema`, imported rather than declared again: this and the item sheet
 * decode the same `LinearIssue` (src/shared/linear/issue-types.ts:3-35), which `linear.searchIssues`
 * and `linear.listIssues` return (src/main/runtime/rpc/methods/linear.ts:50-56,

 * requirements are all non-optional on that type, and two of them are reads that throw here:
 * `createLinearTask` reads `issue.state.name` and `issue.team.name` with no guard
 * (mobile-tasks-item-mapping.ts:296-297), and `getLinearPriorityRank(issue.priority)` feeds
 * `a.priority - b.priority` (mobile-tasks-reviewer-linear.ts:100/:102), where an absent priority makes
 * the whole comparator NaN and orders the reviewer list arbitrarily.
 *
 * An earlier version of this file declared its own row requiring `id` alone, on the grounds that
 * the recorded smart-search rows were `{ id: 'issue-1' }`. Those rows were a fixture defect, not
 * evidence: no Linear issue the host can build lacks `state` or `team`. The fixtures now carry real
 * rows and main's rendering of them is recorded before this requirement lands.
