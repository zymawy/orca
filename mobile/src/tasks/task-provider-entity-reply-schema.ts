// The entities the tasks screen's provider replies are built out of: the mutation envelope every
// GitHub/GitLab/Linear write answers with, a conversation comment, an assignable user, a review
// summary, a check row and a changed file. Checked against src/main/github/issue-create.ts,
// issue-update.ts, issue-comment.ts, client/create/add-pr-review-comment.ts and the shared
// GitHubCommentResult / GitHubCreateIssueResult types the host returns from them.
//
// Two rules run through this file and the four schema modules beside it.
//
// 1. A member is required only where a tasks consumer reads it with no guard. Everything the
//    consumer reaches through `?.`, `??` or a `typeof` test stays optional, because main read it
//    that way and a reply without it rendered the same fallback it renders now.
// 2. No member is required that the site's own recorded `normal` reply does not carry. The corpus
//    is the only evidence of what a host really sends at each site, and requiring a member absent
//    from that control would turn a good reply into an incompatible one. Where that rule holds a
//    schema looser than the host's own type, the schema says so at the member.
//
// Member helpers come from the session domain's entity module rather than a second copy: they are
// plain salvaged-member combinators over zod-salvage, and one definition is what keeps "absent
// stays absent, malformed reads as absent" identical on both surfaces.

// Pinned to the host's own union through hostUnionArms: an arm added or dropped host-side fails tsc.

/**
 * One conversation comment, as every task sheet holds it.
 *
 * `id` and `body` are the only required members, and they are the two `DetailComment` declares
 * non-optional: the timeline keys rows by id and renders body unguarded. Every other member is
 * reached through `?.` or `??` — commentAuthor (mobile-tasks-item-comments.tsx:47) is the shape of
 * all of them — so it stays optional and is passed through exactly as the host sent it.
 *
 * A reaction's `content` is forwarded, not matched against an arm set. Three producers feed this
 * one list and they disagree: GitHub sends `GitHubReactionContent` (`'+1'`, `'-1'`, `laugh`, ...,
 * src/shared/github/comment-types.ts:3-17, normalised from GraphQL in
 * src/main/github/comment-reactions.ts:19-27), and GitLab sends `GitLabReaction { name, count }`
 * with no `content` at all (src/shared/gitlab-types.ts:60-72). An arm set drawn from either one
 * drops the other producer's rows outright, so the reader keeps `count` — the only member read
 * unguarded, by the `count > 0` filter at mobile-tasks-item-comments.tsx:145 — and hands `content`
 * to the glyph lookup exactly as it arrived.

 *

 * consumers test `=== 'VIEWED'` (mobile-tasks-item-review-sections.tsx:237,

 * itself, exactly as main's unchecked reader passed it, instead of vanishing.
 *
 * `status` stays closed, and the arms are not mobile's invention: the host validates this same
 * seven-arm set on the way back in, as a zod enum on `github.prFileContents`' own params
 * (src/shared/rpc-contract/github-pull-request-params.ts:63, matching `GitHubPRFile.status` at

 * (use-mobile-tasks-github-check-file-actions.tsx:196,
 * use-mobile-tasks-project-file-merge-actions.tsx:78), so a forwarded eighth arm could not reach
 * the wire without a cast, and if it did the host would refuse the call on its own params. Dropping
 * to absent sends `?? 'modified'` instead, which fetches both sides and renders a diff.
