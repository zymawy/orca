 * — the stylesheet, the elements it reads by id, the engine on `window`, a `postMessage` back to
 * React Native and the frames that arrive on it — this supplies instead, through the ten seams
 * and the host element.
 *
 * A call is a document. Nothing here is shared between two of them and nothing is reset: each call
 * builds its own scope, so a second mount cannot reach the first one's state, and a stale callback
 * from a mount that has gone away reads the scope it closed over rather than the live one.
