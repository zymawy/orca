 * preedit is plain ASCII — so the marked-text range decides and no code point is
 * ever classified. That is what makes this hold for input methods nobody tested.
 *
 * `composing` is undefined only where the platform reports no range at all —
 * today React Native Android and the page on Android. The fallback holds the
 * trailing non-ASCII run: a conversion IME always leaves one and ASCII keeps its
 * zero-latency echo. It enumerates nothing, and it cannot see an ASCII preedit —
