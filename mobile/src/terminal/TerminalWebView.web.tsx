/**
 * The same terminal, with the WebView taken out.
 *
 * `react-native-webview` has no web build that renders anything: on the page it paints the line
 * "React Native WebView does not support this platform" where the terminal was. So the page mounts
 * the document itself — xterm as an import, the document as the factory the WebView's own script is
 * generated from — and keeps the contract above it exactly as it was. `TerminalPaneView` and the subscription foundation hold
 * `TerminalWebViewProps` and `TerminalWebViewHandle` and cannot tell which of the two they have.
 *
 * Both halves of the transport are the same objects the native component uses: the commands are
 * `TerminalWebViewCommand`, handed to the document's own `handleMsg` instead of across a bridge,
 * and every notify goes back through the controller's `receive`, which is the same dispatch.
