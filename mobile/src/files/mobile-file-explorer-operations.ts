/**
 * The Files tab's directory read and the capped list it falls back to.
 *
 * Both skip rather than throw, because neither refusal is an error the operation decides: the
 * `files.readDir` refusal is what selects the fallback (a desktop predating the mobile allowlist
 * answers `method_not_found`), and the `files.list` refusal supplies the message the screen shows.
 * No acceptance policy exposes a refusal code, so the panel reads the envelope's own error the way
 * `mobile-file-preview-operations.ts` does, and only these two consumers want one.
 *
 * A malformed *accepted* reply is what moves: the panel's own catch already turns a throw into the
 * inline directory error it drew for a failed load, so an unreadable listing now names the reply
 * instead of crashing the row builder one render later.
