/**
 * Leaving the preview, and the one question that can stop it.
 *
 * The prompt is a `ConfirmModal` rather than `Alert.alert`, because React Native Web's `Alert` is
 * `static alert() {}` — a silent no-op. Inside the shell's page that turned Back with an unsaved
 * draft into a button that did nothing at all: no prompt, and no navigation either.
 *
 * `ConfirmModal` is what every other confirm in this app uses, and it keeps the modal semantics the
 * native screen had before the page existed. It is a `BottomDrawer`, which C3 first wrote around
 * because C1.9 had Reanimated's animated styles never reaching the DOM node on WKWebView; C1.10
 * (`b7c06900e2`) fixed that by giving the mapper hooks a dependency array, and the drawer render
 * check now holds it on WebKit as well as Chromium.
 *
 * The claim runs on both platforms through one seam: the hardware key natively, and the shell's
 * key inside the page. `leave` is the route handoff's own `back`, which asks the shell to pop the
 * screen the page was pushed onto, so the prompt and what follows it mean the same thing on either.
