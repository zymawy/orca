/**
 * Every shape of a real file path that the bridge's route vocabulary would refuse as a segment.
 *
 * None of them is refused, and that is the design: the pathname spells only `hostId` and
 * `worktreeId`, and the path itself is a param. This is the test that says so for each one rather
 * than for a representative.
 *
 * What the percent-encoding is load-bearing for is narrower than "every path", and the two lists
 * below are that split rather than a claim over the whole set. Two different rules decide it, and
 * neither is about paths:
 *
 *  - the query half of `BRIDGE_ROUTE_HREF_PATTERN` is `[^#\s]*`, so it refuses whitespace of any
 *    kind and a `#`, and admits everything else verbatim;
 *  - the reader is `URLSearchParams`, which is form-urlencoded: it takes `&` as the end of the
 *    pair, `+` as a space, and `%XX` as an escape.
 *
 * So a value needs the encoder exactly when it carries whitespace, `#`, `&`, `+`, or a `%` that
 * begins a valid escape. A `/`, a dot segment, an `=` after the first one, a lone `%` and non-ASCII
 * all pass both rules untouched. That is why hand-joining the query in `stringifyRouteHref` reds
 * some of these paths and not others, and why this file pins the two groups by behaviour instead
 * of asserting one rule over a list of paths.
