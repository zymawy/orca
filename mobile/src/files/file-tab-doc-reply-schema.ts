 * mobile-file-tab-doc.ts:68 renders `content` as the html body and :73-75 puts `content`,
 * `truncated` and `byteLength` into the `file` arm, whose size label and truncation banner read
 * them as a number and a boolean. A reply missing one rendered `undefined` in the tab. All three
 * are declared required by RuntimeFileReadResult, so no host that answers this method omits them.

 * `isImage` is truthy (mobile-file-tab-doc.ts:58), so a reply without a string content was a
 * TypeError. RuntimeFilePreviewResult declares it required.
 *
 * `mimeType` is a plain optional rather than a salvaged one, because main had no fallback for a
 * wrong type here either: `mimeType?.startsWith` threw on a non-string, and readFileTab's catch
 * showed "Couldn't load file preview". An incompatible reply reaches that same catch with that same
 * copy, where salvaging to absent would instead have shown 'Binary preview unavailable'.

 * it to a boolean would drop an image main rendered.

 * Every other arm of `git.diff`, including one this build has not heard of.
 *
 * The arm set is a wire surface, so an unknown `kind` degrades here rather than refusing the reply:
 * mobile-file-tab-doc.ts:41 asks only `kind !== 'text'`, and an unknown arm took this branch on
 * main too. `kind` is therefore any string but `text` — routing an unreadable *text* diff here
 * instead would render "Binary preview unavailable" for a diff whose contents simply did not
 * arrive, which names the file rather than the reply.
 *
 * Nothing in the arm is required: mobileDiffImageDataUri guards every member it reads
 * (mobile-diff-image-preview.ts:22-33) and answers null — 'binary_file' — for anything it cannot
 * use. `isImage` and `modifiedDeleted` are `=== true` comparisons, so a salvaged member lands on
 * main's own arm; `mimeType` is a plain optional for the same reason the image tab's is.
 *
 * `kind` is admitted as any string but `text` and answered as `binary`, because that is the arm the
 * client resolved rather than the token the host sent: no consumer forwards or renders it, and
 * naming it `binary` is what lets the tab tell the two arms apart without re-testing the string.
