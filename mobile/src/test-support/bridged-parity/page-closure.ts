 * One semantics for every series. C1 and C5 each pinned their own goldens with their own copy of
 * these four helpers, identical but for the names, and the copies are the problem rather than the
 * duplication: the pins are the instrument two domains argue about when a golden moves between
 * families they share, and two spellings of "what drifted" can disagree about the answer while both
 * stay green. C5's closure contains C1's 22 families entire, so they read the same goldens.
 *
 * The table itself stays per series. That is the evidence each series certified, and it is meant to
 * be read as a diff when it changes.
