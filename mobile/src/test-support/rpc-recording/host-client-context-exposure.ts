 *
 * One constant rather than the same string in five adapter modules. The name it reaches for is not
 * an import, so no type checker sees it and a rename of the local surfaces as a `ReferenceError`
 * mid-recording; five hand-copied spellings are five independent ways to arrive there, and
 * `adapter-seam.test.ts` both pins the local against the product source and refuses a sixth copy.
 * The cost is where the pin lives: this text is inside `recorderSha256`, so editing it re-records
 * the whole corpus rather than the five families that mount through it.
