/**
 * Each probe exists because a real mutation survived the whole pre-probe suite. Hole and closure
 * are asserted together: if a pre-probe scenario of the same operation also caught the mutation,
 * the probe is redundant and this test says so instead of letting it accumulate.
 *
 * The six session entries are the same shape one step later: each names a guard whose false arm
 * no session recording reached, because every scenario of its family declared the cell filled. The
 * closing scenario declares it empty, so the member the guard drops is absent from the wire and the
 * mutant that always sends it has somewhere to diverge. Two of them close a cell an adapter
 * constant used to fill: while the worktree and the active tab were fixtures rather than
 * arguments, no scenario could describe a session that has neither.
