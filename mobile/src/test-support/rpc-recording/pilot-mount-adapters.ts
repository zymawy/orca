/**
 * The mount table one recording runs against: every registered domain module, merged. Nothing is
 * mounted here, because an adapter defined in this file would be pinned by `recorderSha256` on
 * every golden rather than by `adapterSha256` on the goldens that mount it.
 *
 * Each module gets its own loader, carrying its own exposures. One recording mounts one adapter, so
 * a golden is only ever influenced by the exposures its own module declares — which is what lets
 * `adapterSha256` pin them instead of every golden's `recorderSha256`.
