 * The matrix's `normal` partition replays a result the family already records, so no migrator has
 * to invent a plausible payload per domain. A few sites have no recorded success to replay, and
 * those are inventoried here rather than skipped: a new domain whose scenarios only record failures
 * fails the suite until it is given a fulfilled scenario or a line below. Both directions are
 * checked — an entry whose family has since recorded a success fails too, and family-recordings
 * asserts every entry names a live matrix site — so the list only shrinks.
