/**
 * `optional` belongs to generated steps only: a matrix variant answers one request differently, so
 * the requests scripted after it may never be sent. Skipping one the operation never asked for
 * records what it actually did; a scripted step the manifest declares is never optional. A frame
 * carries no such flag — the registry routes every streaming response to the id that opened the
 * stream, so a frame after a divergence is always deliverable.
 *
 * `frame` names the subscribe payload it is delivered on and carries a whole host response, which
 * the real stream registry routes — `ready`, a data event, `end` and a refusal are all one kind.
 * `params` asserts the subscribe params, the same contract `complete` holds for a request.
