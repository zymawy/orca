/**
 * One host's lifetime-usage row.
 *
 * Nothing here is required, not even the object, and the schema is total for the same reason.
 * `totalHomeStats` is the reader and it guards the row itself
 * (`if (!host || typeof host !== 'object') continue`, home-stats-total.ts:40), so requiring an
 * object would buy nothing at the read and would cost the row upstream: the refusal reaches
 * `fetchMobileHomeStats`'s `.catch`, the per-host slot is never written, `hostIds.filter` finds no
 * host, `totalHomeStats` returns null and the header draws no stats row where main drew a zeroed
 * one. `.nullish()` alone only covered null and absent; a non-object still refused, which is the
 * same regression for a reply main tolerated, so the catch makes any unreadable row decode as
 * absent and land in the slot the total already skips.
 *
 * `firstEventAt` keeps its explicit `null`: that is the host's "no events yet", and the total
 * distinguishes it from a number when taking the minimum.
