/** Names already spent in a repo, including workspaces that have since been deleted.

 *  Why a targeted request rather than the workspace catalog: the catalog is served by `worktree.ps`,
 *  which carries rows only. Retired names are needed just while the create sheet is open and only
 *  for one repo, so this asks for exactly that.
 *
 *  `refreshKey` must change on every workspace-list mutation. Caching rules live in
 *  `retired-name-cache` so this and the desktop hook cannot drift on what a failure means, and no
 *  loading state is reported because create is never gated on this fetch. */
