 * Opening a URL outside the app, which is one call on a phone and a request to the shell on the web.
 *
 * Native: the app's own `Linking`, and nothing between a screen and it but the two ways it fails.
 * It rejects for a URL no installed app claims, and it *throws* before returning a promise for one
 * its own validation refuses, so a `.catch` alone leaves that second one escaping a tap handler.
 * Both are reported and neither is rethrown.
 *
 * The web sibling is where this earns its name: inside the shell the page is a document with no
 * `Linking` of its own, so the URL is handed back to the app that has one.
