 *
 * The shape is the native one: a permission and an open, a start and a stop, and two event lanes.
 * That is deliberate. The page's pull is what `dictation-capture.web.ts` turns into these events,
 * so the flow above the seam cannot tell which host it is on, and the native half is the calls it
 * always made in the order it always made them. The screen is not here at all: an open microphone
