/**
 * The native half of the capture seam: the calls it makes, and which interruptions end a capture.
 *
 * Thin by design — this file is five device calls behind a shape the page can answer — but the
 * interruption rule is shared with `dictation-capture.web.ts` and is exactly where the two drifted:
 * the page treated every interruption as a loss while this one has always gated on `began` and
 * `blocked`, so an `ended` on its own cancelled a live dictation on the page and nothing natively.
