 * `expo-clipboard` resolves to `navigator.clipboard` on the web, which needs a secure context —
 * and the iOS shell serves the page from a custom scheme while Android serves `https`, so that
 * path would work on one platform and not the other with no way to tell from here. The verb goes
 * to the shell instead, where the pasteboard is the device's.
 *
 * A route that did not declare `native.clipboard.write` is not granted it, and the call rejects
 * before a frame is sent; the callers' own `catch` puts that on screen.

/**
 * Web sibling: the shell reads text for the page with one verb and stages an image with three.
 *
 * `native.clipboard.read` is text and only text: `BRIDGE_CLIPBOARD_MIMES` is `['text']`, so an
 * image mime is not a refusal the verb spells out but a value its schema does not admit, answered
 * `invalid-params`. Widening it cannot work — `CLIPBOARD_IMAGE_MAX_BASE64_CHARS` is 24 MiB against
 * a reply cap of 8 MiB. So an image on the pasteboard is `native.media.pick { source: 'clipboard' }`
 * instead: the shell stages it and answers a handle, the bytes come back a chunk at a time under
 * the frame cap, and the handle goes back. The result is the same `{ data, size }` the phone's
 * `getImageAsync` answers, so the terminal's paste and the upload path below it are unchanged.
 *
 * Null still means "nothing there", which is what an empty pasteboard answers on both platforms
 * and the branch the paste already takes. Every other outcome rejects, because a refused pick and
 * an empty clipboard lead a caller to different screens.
 *
 * `contents` cannot be a probe. The shell serves no "is there text" verb and reading to find out
 * would raise iOS's paste-consent prompt on every mount and every foreground, which is the whole
 * reason `hasStringAsync` exists. So it answers what this side actually knows: a shell that granted
 * the read verb may have text, and one that granted the media verbs may have an image. The paste
 * button is enabled on a maybe and the read is what settles it, which is the same order a phone
 * runs when the probe throws.
 *
 * Per grant, not on the pair: a route granted only `native.clipboard.read` can paste text, and
 * answering on both would tell it its clipboard is empty.
