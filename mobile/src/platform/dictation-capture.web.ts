/**
 * Web sibling: the page has no microphone, so the shell holds one and the page drains it.
 *
 * Pulled rather than pushed, because the page-facing seam is request/reply by rule and the one
 * shell-to-page push there is belongs to an RPC `subscribe`. A push lane for bytes the page hands
 * straight back to the desktop would be a new frame kind, capability-negotiated, carrying audio
 * that is already in this process.
 *
 * So the shell rings and this drains on a timer, turning replies into the events
 * `dictation-capture.ts` gets from the engine directly. Above the seam neither host is visible: the
 * same state machine, the same budget, the same routing.
 *
 * Every refusal rejects as the `NativeVerbError` the bridge built, with the reason on it — except
 * a read, whose refusal is a capture that is gone and reaches the interruption lane instead,
 * because that is the state it is and the one the flow already knows how to leave.
