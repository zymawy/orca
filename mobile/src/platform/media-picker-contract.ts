/**
 * What picking media means to the screens, free of any device API.
 *
 * The two siblings of `media-picker.ts` agree on this and nothing else: one opens the OS pickers
 * over `expo-image-picker` and `expo-document-picker`, the other asks the shell for them over
 * `native.media.pick` / `read` / `release`. Neither type nor error may live beside an Expo import,
 * because a screen that catches `ImageLibraryPermissionError` would otherwise drag the native
 * picker chain into the page bundle for the sake of one `instanceof`.
 *
 * The pasteboard is not here: `platform/clipboard.ts` owns it on both platforms, and on the web
 * its `readImage` reaches the same `native.media.pick` with `source: 'clipboard'`.
