 * two listener pairs and two renders per keyboard event.
 *
 * The web sibling is where this earns its place under `platform/`: react-native-web's `Keyboard` is
 * a stub — `addListener` returns a subscription that never fires and `isVisible()` is always false
 * — so a screen inside the shell's page that waits for a keyboard event waits forever, and the
 * software keyboard covers whatever sits at the bottom of the document. There the two facts come
 * apart, and neither is an event.
