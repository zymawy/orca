// Why this file exists: the chunk sender takes what the capture seam hands over, and a microphone
// event is not that — it carries no drop count, and the page's whole reason for a drop count is
// audio the shell's ring could not hold. Typed as the event, the sender accepted either and read
// `droppedBytes` off neither, so a page that had dropped audio sent it as though nothing was
// missing. Every expect-error below is that claim as an assertion: tsc fails on a directive that
// stops catching an error, so `tsc -p tsconfig.json` is the gate. Nothing here runs and no app code
// imports it.
