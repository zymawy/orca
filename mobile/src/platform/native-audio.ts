/**

 * The microphone opens here, inside the shell, which is the whole reason these are verbs: a page
 * served from a custom scheme has no `getUserMedia` worth having, and the OS permission prompt is
 * the shell's to run. What crosses back is PCM, because the page is what speaks
 * `speech.dictation.*` to the desktop — transcription runs there, and putting that protocol in the
 * binary would freeze it until a store release.
 *
 * Every engine call is injectable for the reason the media verbs' are: the arms worth pinning — a
 * denied microphone, an engine that will not open, a ring that filled, an interruption — are the
 * ones a simulator makes expensive, and none of them is a fact about Swift.
