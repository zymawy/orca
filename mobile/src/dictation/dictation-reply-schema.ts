/**
 * One model row in the setup sheet.
 *
 * `id` is required: it is the React key the list renders by, the value `isSelected` compares
 * against, and — the reason it cannot be salvaged — the `modelId` the download, delete and select
 * sends put back on the wire. A row without one drops rather than failing the whole sheet, which is
 * the same rule the terminal inventory uses for a row it cannot address.
 *
 * `provider` and `status` are closed arm sets on the wire, so an arm this build has not heard of
 * degrades to absent rather than refusing the reply or dropping the row. Absent is the right
 * degrade here and not a coincidence: every read of either is an equality test against a known arm
 * (`provider === 'openai'`, `status === 'ready'`, isModelInFlight), so an unknown arm already fell
 * through to the same branch on main. Nothing is withheld that the row otherwise granted.
 *
 * `label`, `sizeBytes` and `progress` are decoration behind main's own guards — `!bytes`,
 * `progress != null` — so a salvaged member lands on exactly the meta string main drew.
 * `recommended` stays `z.unknown()` because the badge gates on truthiness, not on `=== true`.

/**
 * The whole dictation setup, which all three of the list, the delete and the config write answer
 * with — the sheet renders the reply in place of a refetch, so one schema covers the three.
 *
 * `models` is required: MobileDictationSetupSheet.tsx:49 and VoiceModelList.tsx:53 read `.some` and
 * `.map` on it with no guard, so a reply without one was a TypeError inside the sheet's own refresh.
 *
 * `dictationMode` is forwarded as the string the host sent, not as an arm set. Every consumer is an
 * equality test against `toggle` or `hold` — the voice-settings segments, the terminal input mic and
 * the native-chat composer — so a mode this build has not heard of renders the same inert control
 * whether it arrives verbatim or as a substitute, and forwarding is the one that makes no version
 * claim. It is NOT required even though the host declares it so: main rendered a sheet without one,
 * and an absent mode stays absent here so the mic it feeds is as inert as main's was.
 *
 * `enabled` and `selectedModelId` stay salvaged: both are read behind `!`/`===` and a reply missing
 * either renders an off switch and no selected row, which is what main rendered for the same reply.
