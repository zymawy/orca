// A skip's reader runs only on a reply the policy already admitted, so an unreadable one throws
// rather than skipping. Both readers that project a list are inside the metadata refresh's own
// try/catch, which already treats a failed refresh as "retry on the next one"; the four writes read
// no reply body at all. host-screen-reply-schema.ts says which members each screen actually reads.
