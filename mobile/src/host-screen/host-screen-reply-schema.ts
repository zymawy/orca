/**
 * The host's repo catalog, narrowed to what the label maps are built from.
 *
 * `id` and `displayName` are required and a row without either drops: `displayName` is the key of
 * four Maps and the argument `repoColor` hashes with `name.charCodeAt` — a row without one was a
 * TypeError that took the whole metadata refresh with it — and `id` is the Map value the workspace
 * rows resolve their host through.
 *
 * `badgeColor` sits behind main's own `||` fallback to `repoColor`, so a salvaged member draws the
 * same swatch. `repoIcon` is declared as the three arms MobileRepoIcon renders, and an arm this
 * build has not heard of degrades to absent — which is the Folder default that component already
 * drew for an arm it could not match, so the row keeps its label either way.
 * The image arm deliberately stops at `src` and `label`: those are the members the component reads,
 * and `source` — which it never reads — is left to pass through. Declaring it as the four arms
 * `RepoIconImageSource` spells today would have dropped the WHOLE icon for a source a later host
 * adds, drawing a Folder where main drew the image; passthrough keeps the member on the object
 * verbatim, which is also what `settings-repo-metadata-icons` records.
 * `connectionId` and `executionHostId` are declared as plain strings rather than as
 * the host-id template union they are typed with: the union is a wire surface, and
 * `getRepoExecutionHostId` — which is what every read of them goes through — already answers `local`
 * for a spelling it cannot parse. Narrowing them here would refuse a newer host's own rows.
