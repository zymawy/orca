 * Every host-route target the host page builds, and whether its host id survives being one segment.

 * admits any non-empty string, so an id carrying `/`, `?`, `#` or whitespace stops being the single
 * segment `matchesRoutePattern` reads it as the moment it is interpolated raw. Inside the shell's
 * page that decides where a tap goes: the handoff matches the pathname against the shell's
 * `pageRoutes` before it chooses between this document and the native stack.
 *
 * A census rather than six assertions, because the failure is a habit and not a bug: each of these
 * sites was written by copying the one next to it, and the seventh will be too.
