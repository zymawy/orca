 * inert subscription — so the page claims the key from the shell over the bridge instead, and the
 * shell hands one press back. One call site, both platforms.
 *
 * The claim is held in a ref, so a caller that rebuilds its handler every render registers once:
 * only taking the key and letting it go move the subscription.
