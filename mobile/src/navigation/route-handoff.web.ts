/**
 * Web sibling: a route the page renders it takes, a route it does not it hands back, and a target
 * it can do neither with it refuses.
 *
 * The page is one document standing in for one screen, so a route the shell says is the page's is
 * pushed here and every other one goes to the shell, which pushes the native screen over the
 * still-mounted view; Back reveals the page with nothing reloaded, and the multi-megabyte bundle is
 * never re-executed.
 *
 * Six members are wrapped and the rest are the router's own. Five carry a target — `push`,
 * `replace`, `navigate`, `dismissTo` and `prefetch`, the set `WRAPPED_HREF_MEMBERS` pins — and four
 * of those are decided by one answer: the shell says which routes are the page's, in `init`.
 * `prefetch` is the fifth and is decided differently, below. `back` is the sixth and carries no
 * target at all, so it is decided by this document's own stack instead — what it leaves for is
 * whatever the shell pushed this page onto.
 *
 * The third answer is the one this file used not to have. `handOff` fails for two reasons that are
 * nothing like a page route — an href the protocol's own pattern drops, and a shell that answered
 * no — and falling through to the local router for either mounts a screen this page does not serve:
 * the bundle carries every route under `app/h`, so the fallback does not paint Unmatched, it runs
 * `session/[worktreeId]` on React Native Web inside the shell. Staying put and naming the reason is
 * the lesser failure, and the route policy is what keeps the case off a device in the first place:
 * a shell that grants no `navigate` renders no page route at all.
 *
 * `back` keeps a fallthrough the target-takers lost, and for the reason they lost theirs: it has no
 * target to mount, so `router.back()` on a document holding one history entry is the same nothing
 * a refusal would have been.
 *
 * Each target-taker is `(href, options?)` and forwards both on its local branch. Options do not
 * cross to the shell: the `navigate` notify carries an href and nothing else, so a target handed
 * over is opened by the native stack on that stack's own terms. Nothing in this tree passes one
 * today; the wrappers took the href alone until a review found it, which is exactly how a caller
 * that starts passing one would have had it dropped without a word.
 *
 * Whether the target names a screen that exists is nobody's business here; the shape is all this
 * can check, and C1.7 is where a real route-existence check belongs.
