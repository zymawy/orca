/**
 * Web sibling: the address input goes on the text-input seam, which holds it at or above the size
 * below which iOS zooms the page on focus.
 *
 * That zoom is not cosmetic here. `keyboard-occlusion.web.ts` reads a visual viewport scale other
 * than 1 as "not a keyboard" and answers 0, so one focus of a 12px address bar would leave the
 * pane's keyboard lift at 0 for the rest of the typing session — C4.2's failure, on a screen its
 * census does not yet walk.
 *
 * The line height follows the size rather than staying at the native 16, which would clip a 16px
 * glyph, and the file label follows both so the address does not resize as focus moves.
