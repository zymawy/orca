/**
 * The page's frame budget, checked against the frame the shell really posts.
 *
 * `browser-screencast-request.web.ts` sizes the mobile view from `binaryEventEnvelopeBytes()`, a
 * bound it derives from a skeleton it builds itself. Its own suite checks that bound against
 * another skeleton of the same shape, which is two copies of one assumption agreeing. This is the
 * case that makes it evidence: a real `event.binary` encoded by C6.1's encoder and serialized by
 * the real `BridgeHostSubscriptions`, measured, and the bound held above it.
 *
 * C6 ruling 2's pin. The frames are generated noise at the budgeted scale rather than a fixture
 * committed to the tree: the budget's worst case is the image JPEG compresses least, and a
 * downloaded photograph would sit a tenth of the way to it and prove nothing.
 *
 * Measured at this base, so a later reader can tell drift from a rewrite: the real envelope costs
 * 303 bytes against a bound of 516, and a frame at the budgeted area is an image the shell posts
 * just under the 655,360-byte cap. The area itself moved when the worst case was swept properly,
 * so the figures are derived here rather than written down.
