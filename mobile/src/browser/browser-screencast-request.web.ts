 * The bytes one pixel of this pane's JPEG costs at its worst.
 *
 * Uniform random noise at quality 72, which is the image JPEG compresses least and the ceiling
 * every real page sits under; photographic content measures near a tenth of it.
 *
 * Swept 2026-09-20 over 143 viewports — widths 320 to 1400 and heights 480 to 1600 — each frame
 * encoded at the scale `budgetedMobileViewDeviceScaleFactor` picks for it. Across the 111 the
 * budget fits, `Page.startScreencast` measured 0.543986 to 0.552964 bytes per pixel. This is that
 * maximum plus a margin of 0.007036, about 1.3%, for the encoder version it was not swept on.
 *
 * Re-measured on the real encoder, which was the point of the exercise: the first sweep used
 * `canvas.toDataURL` and read 0.54470 to 0.55351, while the product's frames come from
 * `Page.startScreencast`. The two agree to within a thousandth of a byte per pixel, and the
 * screencast is the marginally cheaper of them, so the encoder is not what makes a budgeted frame
 * miss. `mobile-web-app-frame-budget-sweep.test.ts` now drives the screencast, so the number and
 * the product share one encoder, and re-running it is how this number is changed.
 *
 * It was 0.545 before any sweep, taken from one 2400x2160 frame. A single large frame is the
 * cheapest per pixel in the whole range, so the number it gave was under 90 of those 143 viewports
 * and the budget it produced posted a frame over the cap on a phone. A worst case measured at one
 * point is not a worst case.
 *
 * What this margin does not cover: the C6.6 device proof, with the budget on, dropped 1 frame in
 * 41 at 402x593, which needs about 0.5649 bytes per pixel — above everything either sweep has
 * seen. Nothing here reproduces it, so it is not folded into this constant; a frame that still
 * does not fit is C6 ruling 1's to drop.
