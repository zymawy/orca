 * Native: the address bar is a compact control and carries the theme's meta size, which is what it
 * has always rendered at.
 *
 * The `.web.ts` sibling raises it, because in a browser an input under 16px zooms the page on focus
 * and the page's keyboard seam reads that zoom as "no keyboard". The label and the input move
 * together: the label is painted over the field whenever it is not focused, so a size that differed
 * would resize the address on every focus.
