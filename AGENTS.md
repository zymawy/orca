# Design System

All UI work — layout, color, typography, spacing, component selection, UX behavior — must follow [`docs/STYLEGUIDE.md`](./docs/STYLEGUIDE.md). Most of it is linted: `pnpm run check:code-quality:changed` fails on new restyles of a `components/ui/` primitive, raw palette colors, and computed `className` strings; `pnpm lint` fails on any class Tailwind cannot generate. See the Enforcement section of the style guide before suppressing either. Use the tokens defined in `src/renderer/src/assets/main.css` (the canonical source) and the shadcn primitives in `src/renderer/src/components/ui/`. Don't invent new color values, font sizes, or shadow tiers when a documented one already covers the role. When STYLEGUIDE.md is silent, follow the resolution order in its final section.

## Electron UI Validation

Always run tests and agent-launched apps in the background with `ORCA_BACKGROUND_LAUNCH=1`.
Never steal monitor focus or reveal test windows: no `show()`, `showInactive()`, `bringToFront()`,
`app.focus()`, or OS activation. Use CDP screenshots of hidden renderers. Keep native-focus and
visible-window tests paused on the user's desktop; run them on an isolated display or CI.
Rebuild modified launch-policy code before running an app; stale build wrappers are not safe.

Use the `$electron` skill and Playwright CDP for rendered Orca UI checks. Do not use computer-use for Orca UI validation.

# Style

## Reuse Before Reimplementing

Before writing new logic at any scale — a function, component, IPC channel, state store, or whole subsystem/flow — check whether an existing implementation already does the job (or nearly does). Extend or generalize it instead of building a parallel version; only write from scratch when nothing fits. Keep the check proportionate: a quick search for trivial code, a real one before building anything substantial.

## Concise/Brief Non-obvious Comments ONLY

- DO NOT: be verbose, explain the obvious, walk through the code ("WHY not HOW")
- BE CONCISE. 1 LINE if possible

## Lint Rules: Do Not Disable Max Lines

NEVER add a `max-lines` disable (`eslint-disable max-lines`, `oxlint-disable max-lines`, or line-specific variants), and never add a per-file `max-lines` bump in `mobile/.oxlintrc.json`.

## File and Module Naming

Never use vague names like `helpers`, `utils`, `common`, `misc`, or `shared-stuff` for files, folders, or modules. They carry zero info and tend to become dumping grounds. Name files after what they _actually_ contain — prefer the concrete domain concept (e.g. `tab-group-state.ts`, `terminal-orphan-cleanup.ts`) over the generic role (`tabs-helpers.ts`, `terminal-utils.ts`). If you find yourself reaching for `helpers`, the file probably has more than one responsibility and should be split, or there's a better name hiding in the code that describes what the functions operate on.

## Type Declarations: Prefer `.ts` Over `.d.ts`

## Type Assertions: Prefer Checked Types

Avoid type assertions except `as const`. Unavoidable casts need a line-specific `SAFETY:` explanation:

```ts
// oxlint-disable-next-line typescript/consistent-type-assertions -- SAFETY: Explain the verified invariant here.
```

# Verifying Changes

- **Typecheck**: `pnpm tc` (or `tc:node` / `tc:cli` / `tc:web`)
- **Test**: `pnpm test [path/to/file.test.ts]`
- **Lint**: `oxlint`, or `pnpm run check:code-quality:changed` for changed files (full `pnpm lint` is slow); format with `pnpm format`
- **Design system**: `pnpm run lint:design-system` for the full renderer report (not a gate); the changed-lines gate above is what CI enforces

# Writing Pull Requests

Fill in [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](./.github/pull_request_template.md), written for a reviewer who has never seen this code:

- No jargon — plain language, no internal shorthand.
- The before and after as the user experiences it.
- The mechanism you changed, not just the symptom.
- Why this approach over the alternatives you considered.

Cover all four concisely. Don't pad or walk the diff.

# Considerations

## Worktree Safety

Always use the primary working directory (the worktree) for all file reads and edits. Never follow absolute paths from subagent results that point to the main repo.

## Cross-Platform Support

Orca targets macOS, Linux, and Windows. Keep all platform-dependent behavior behind runtime checks:

- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Never hardcode `e.metaKey`. Use a platform check (`navigator.userAgent.includes('Mac')`) to pick `metaKey` on Mac and `ctrlKey` on Linux/Windows. Electron menu accelerators should use `CmdOrCtrl`.
- **Shortcut labels in UI**: Display `⌘` / `⇧` on Mac and `Ctrl+` / `Shift+` on other platforms.
- **File paths**: Use `path.join` or Electron/Node path utilities — never assume `/` or `\`.
- **Windows terminal shells**: `--shell` picks the shell a terminal _is_; `--command` is typed into whatever shell the host spawned, so a shell choice routed through `command` silently becomes a child process. See [`docs/reference/windows-terminal-shell-selection.md`](./docs/reference/windows-terminal-shell-selection.md).
- **Windows setup scripts**: the setup/issue-command runner is a `.cmd` batch file unless the script starts with a `#!` line — never derive that from the user's terminal-shell preference, and never launch a `.cmd` runner with a bare `cmd.exe /c` from a Git Bash pane (MSYS rewrites the `/c`). See [`docs/reference/windows-setup-shell.md`](./docs/reference/windows-setup-shell.md).
- **Windows child processes**: start them through `runProcess`/`spawnProcess` in `src/shared/child-process/` — never `child_process` directly. It pins `windowsHide`, refuses `shell: true`, and encodes `.cmd`/`.bat` arguments so neither `CommandLineToArgvW` nor `cmd.exe` mangles them. A ratchet test fails on any new direct import. Recognised npm/pnpm `.cmd` shims are resolved to their real target so the spawn skips `cmd.exe` entirely; see [`docs/reference/windows-cmd-shim-resolution.md`](./docs/reference/windows-cmd-shim-resolution.md) before adding a shim shape or debugging one.
- **Ripgrep**: Orca bundles `rg` for every platform, WSL, and SSH remotes. Spawn it through `spawnBundledRipgrep` (main) or `resolveRelayRipgrepCommand` (relay), never a bare `'rg'` — Windows resolves a bare name in the spawn cwd before PATH. Don't add git/readdir fallbacks locally; the relay's chain exists only for hosts an upload never reached.
- **Windows process enumeration**: read the table through `src/main/windows/windows-process-table.ts`, never by forking `powershell.exe`. See [`docs/reference/windows-process-enumeration.md`](./docs/reference/windows-process-enumeration.md).
- **Windows MSYS/Git Bash panes**: their children break away from the per-PTY job unless it is created without `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK`, and a `conpty.node` built before that fix passes every existing gate. Before changing the per-PTY job or debugging `windows-msys-job.win32.test.ts`, read [`docs/reference/windows-msys-job-breakaway.md`](./docs/reference/windows-msys-job-breakaway.md).
- **Windows daemon-host relocation**: the terminal daemon runs from a copy of the app runtime under `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, which is what survives an auto-update. Before touching that copy, its exe name, or the NSIS uninstall macro, read [`docs/reference/windows-daemon-host-relocation.md`](./docs/reference/windows-daemon-host-relocation.md).
- **Windows EDR signal**: don't add `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`, `-EncodedCommand`, `cmd.exe /c` with escaped free text, per-operation interpreter spawning, or runtime `Add-Type` compilation without reading [`docs/reference/windows-edr-posture.md`](./docs/reference/windows-edr-posture.md) first — behavioural EDR scores each of those, and being signed does not clear them.
- **WSL commands**: build argv with `buildWslExecArgs` (always `--exec` — under `--`, `wsl.exe` expands `$name` in every argument and silently rewrites the script), and fence anything whose stdout you parse with `buildWslCapturedLoginShellCommand`, because the interactive login shell prints the distro banner to stdout. See [`docs/reference/wsl-command-execution.md`](./docs/reference/wsl-command-execution.md).
- **Linux native modules**: keep the glibc floor at Ubuntu 20.04 / glibc 2.31. A module compiled from source on a newer runner can reference symbol versions absent on the floor and crash the app on startup. See [`docs/reference/linux-glibc-compatibility.md`](./docs/reference/linux-glibc-compatibility.md); packaging fails if a bundled native binary needs newer glibc.

## Native Dependency Installs

Ordinary `pnpm install` covers the host OS and CPU only. Before packaging for another architecture — including `pnpm build:mac`, which builds x64 and arm64 by default — run `pnpm install:release`. electron-builder only warns on a missing `extraResources` source, so the `beforePack` guard is what turns a thin install into a build failure instead of a silently broken artifact; see [`docs/reference/pnpm-install-policy.md`](./docs/reference/pnpm-install-policy.md).

## SSH Use Case

All changes must consider the SSH use case. Don't assume local-only execution. Before changing anything that reports on, stops, or lists remote work, follow [`docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md`](./docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md): the execution host owns everything that touches execution, and loss of contact is never evidence of process death — the verdict vocabulary is `live` / `unverifiable` / `exited`, with no synonyms.

## Folder Workspace Use Case

All changes must consider folder workspaces as well as git worktrees. Don't assume every workspace is a git worktree.

## Agent Status

The execution host owns agent status in one store, the hook server's, and every reader (sidebar, `worktree ps`, mobile, dashboard) subscribes to it. Before adding a producer, a cache, or a reader-side precedence rule, read [`docs/reference/agent-status-store.md`](./docs/reference/agent-status-store.md): new producers write into that store, and readers keep only presentation policy.

## Agent Terminal Screens

A rule that reads what an agent CLI paints on a terminal — readiness, blocked prompts, idle — must be written against a captured transcript, not a remembered screen. Record one with [`docs/reference/agent-pty-transcript-capture.md`](./docs/reference/agent-pty-transcript-capture.md), which keeps escapes and wrapping intact and scrubs account identifiers before they reach git. Antigravity readiness has no transcript yet and five failed attempts without one; before touching it, read [`docs/reference/antigravity-readiness-evidence.md`](./docs/reference/antigravity-readiness-evidence.md).

## Remote Wire Compatibility

Clients and remote Orca servers update independently, so mixed versions are the normal state. Before changing anything a paired client and host exchange — RPC params, stream frames, or the content either side publishes over them — follow [`docs/reference/remote-wire-compatibility.md`](./docs/reference/remote-wire-compatibility.md). A new optional field is safe; a new stream opcode must be capability-negotiated because decoders drop unknown opcodes silently; and changing what the host publishes reaches old clients even with no wire change.

## Git Binary Compatibility

Orca runs the user's Git binary on native, WSL, and SSH hosts, which may all have different versions. Treat Git 2.25 as the core-workflow baseline and follow [`docs/reference/git-compatibility.md`](./docs/reference/git-compatibility.md).

When adding or changing a Git command:

- Check when every subcommand and option was introduced. For newer behavior, keep a baseline-compatible fallback or degrade safely.
- Use `GitCapabilityCache` with a narrow unsupported-error predicate so recurring operations do not retry a known-invalid command. Do not rely only on `git --version`; wrappers such as `simple-git` do not remove host-version differences.
- Scope capability state to the host that executes Git: native, WSL distro, SSH provider, or relay connection. Cover the first fallback, later cached calls, concurrent probes, and relevant host isolation in tests.
- Keep the real-binary compatibility contract in PR CI current. When adopting a newer Git feature, add its version boundary so the preferred command and fallback both run against representative Git releases.
- Preserve commands that begin with global Git options such as `-c` before the subcommand, including auto-maintenance suppression used by worktree-create fetches.

## Git Scan Safety

- Never enumerate every ref and then run `git ls-tree -r` or `git show` once per ref. That ref × tree fan-out can retain gigabytes of output before a downstream `sort -u` or search can make progress.
- Prefer `rg` over the checked-out files for source searches. For history or refs, use a named ref, an explicit namespace/path, `--max-count`, and a bounded output; do not use an unqualified `--all` scan as a first diagnostic.
- Keep repository-wide commands targeted to the current repository and worktree. If an unbounded scan is genuinely required, measure the ref count first, explain the cost, and get confirmation before running it.

## Git Provider Compatibility

Source-control and review changes must consider GitLab and other supported git providers, not only GitHub. Keep provider-specific behavior behind explicit checks, and avoid GitHub-only naming for generic review concepts.

## GitHub CLI Usage

Be mindful of the user's `gh` CLI API rate limit — batch requests where possible and avoid unnecessary calls. All code, commands, and scripts must be compatible with macOS, Linux, and Windows.
