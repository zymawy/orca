# Contributing to Orca

Thanks for contributing to Orca.

## Before You Start

- Keep changes scoped to a clear user-facing improvement, bug fix, or refactor.
- Orca targets macOS, Linux, and Windows. Every change must stay compatible with all three platforms unless the code is explicitly guarded by a runtime platform check.
- For keyboard shortcuts, use runtime platform checks in renderer code and `CmdOrCtrl` in Electron menu accelerators.
- For shortcut labels, show `⌘` and `⇧` on macOS, and `Ctrl+` and `Shift+` on Linux and Windows.
- For file paths, use Node or Electron path utilities such as `path.join`.
- Orca must work against local repositories, remote servers, and SSH worktrees. Do not assume a process, file, credential, shell, or network path exists only on the local machine.
- Orca supports many CLI agents, integrations, and git providers. Keep generic behavior provider-neutral; guard integration-specific logic behind explicit checks.
- Keep changes well-engineered and performant: follow existing architecture, avoid unnecessary work in hot paths, clean up owned resources, and use concrete module names.
- For UI work, follow [`docs/STYLEGUIDE.md`](../docs/STYLEGUIDE.md), use the tokens and shadcn primitives it specifies, and verify polished behavior across platforms, light/dark mode, and SSH latency.

## Local Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Ordinary installs include native optional dependencies for the current OS and CPU only.
Before a cross-architecture build (including `pnpm build:mac`, which produces both x64 and
arm64 artifacts by default), run `pnpm install:release` to add the other CPU's variants.
See [the install policy](../docs/reference/pnpm-install-policy.md).

## Branch Naming

Use a clear, descriptive branch name that reflects the change.

Good examples:

- `fix/ctrl-backspace-delete-word`
- `feat/shift-enter-newline`
- `chore/update-contributor-guide`

Avoid vague names like `test`, `misc`, or `changes`.

## Before Opening a PR

Run the same checks that CI runs:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Add high-quality tests for behavior changes and bug fixes. Prefer tests that would actually catch a regression, not shallow coverage that only exercises the happy path.

If your change affects UI or interaction behavior, verify it on the platforms it could impact.

## Type Declarations: Prefer `.ts` Over `.d.ts`

Project-owned type declarations belong in `.ts` files. `.d.ts` is reserved for ambient shims (e.g., `env.d.ts`, `vite/client.d.ts`). TypeScript's `skipLibCheck: true` setting applies globally, including to our own `.d.ts` files, which means any unresolved type reference in a `.d.ts` silently becomes `any` at its call sites. Write your types in `.ts` files so the compiler actually checks them.

CI enforces this for `src/preload/` and `src/shared/`.

## Pull Requests

Each pull request should follow [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](./pull_request_template.md). In particular:

- open with an ELI5 of the change (plain language paragraph; the PR title is the one-liner)
- explain what changed and why, and stay focused on a single topic when possible
- for any UI or interaction change, attach **before and after** screenshots (or short videos); if there is no visual change, say `No visual change` and why
- include high-quality tests when behavior changes or bug fixes warrant them
- include a brief code review summary from your AI coding agent that explicitly checks cross-platform compatibility, SSH/remote/local compatibility, supported agent and integration compatibility, performance risk, UI quality when applicable, and basic security risk
- mention any platform-specific, remote/SSH-specific, agent-specific, integration-specific, or git-provider-specific behavior and testing notes
- **Include your X (Twitter) handle** in the PR template Author section — we shout out contributors when we merge features on [@orca_build](https://x.com/orca_build).

## Release Process

Version bumps, tags, and releases are maintainer-managed. Do not include release version changes in a normal contribution unless a maintainer asks for them.

### Cutting a release (maintainers)

All releases are cut from the **Cut Release** GitHub Actions workflow. There is no local `pnpm release:*` script — running releases locally is too easy to get wrong (dirty tree, wrong branch, stale main).

**To cut a release:**

1. Open [Actions → Cut Release](../../actions/workflows/release-cut.yml).
2. Click **Run workflow** and pick:
   - **kind**: one of `rc`, `patch`, `minor`, `major`.
   - **ref**: the branch, tag, or SHA to build from. Defaults to `main`.
3. Run it.

The workflow resolves the next version from GitHub Releases, bumps `package.json`, tags, pushes, and runs the multi-platform build + publish inline.

**How the next version is chosen:**

All stable kinds (`patch`, `minor`, `major`) are computed off the latest _stable_ release, ignoring any RCs in between.

- `kind=rc` + last tag was stable (e.g. `v1.3.14`) → `v1.3.15-rc.0`.
- `kind=rc` + active RC series (e.g. `v1.3.15-rc.2`) → `v1.3.15-rc.3`.
- `kind=patch` + latest stable `v1.3.14` → `v1.3.15` (regardless of any intermediate RCs).
- `kind=minor` + latest stable `v1.3.14` → `v1.4.0`.
- `kind=major` + latest stable `v1.3.14` → `v2.0.0`.

**Safety guarantees:**

- Stable releases are refused if the new version isn't strictly greater than the latest published stable. This is the only rule `electron-updater` actually needs — it compares semver within the `latest` channel, so a regressing stable is the one thing that breaks auto-update for fresh installs.
- Complete RC draft releases created by the release workflow are published before cutting a new tag only when the draft tag was built from the current release ref. Stale drafts are skipped so fixes cut a fresh RC instead of exposing old artifacts.
- If the latest RC tag exists but is still draft-only or missing its GitHub Release, the workflow resumes that tag only when it was built from the current release ref. Otherwise the next RC number is cut.
- RC numbering also considers release commits on `main`, so deleting a stale tag does not let a later cut reuse the same RC number.
- Off-main releases (when `ref` is not the tip of `main`) only push the tag. `main` is never mutated from a non-main ref, so you can safely release an older commit without polluting history.
- When `ref` is the tip of `main`, the version-bump commit is fast-forwarded onto `main` so local `package.json` stays in sync with what's shipped.

**Common scenarios:**

- **Normal release:** `kind=patch`, `ref=main`.
- **"A bad commit just landed on main, release the commit before it":** `kind=patch`, `ref=<good-sha>`. `main` is left alone; the tag points at the good SHA. Fix forward on `main` afterward.
- **One-off RC for a feature branch:** `kind=rc`, `ref=<branch-or-sha>`. Produces an RC tag that does not touch `main`.
- **Minor or major bump:** `kind=minor` or `kind=major`.

The scheduled 2x/day RC cron in [`release-rc.yml`](../../actions/workflows/release-rc.yml) is independent and continues to run automatically from `main`.

## Release Channels

The public Homebrew cask tracks stable desktop releases:

```bash
brew install --cask stablyai/orca/orca
```

Release candidates use a separate cask token:

```bash
brew install --cask stablyai/orca/orca@rc
```

The two casks conflict because both install `Orca.app`. Switch channels with a
normal `brew uninstall --cask` followed by the install for the other channel.
Do not use `--zap` unless you intentionally want to remove local Orca state.
