/**
 * Server-restart half of the tab-persistence contract. The client-quit half is covered by
 * paired-client-hosted-browser-quit-survival.spec.ts.
 *
 * Two real Electron processes: a headless paired runtime whose serve process is genuinely replaced
 * mid-test, and a desktop client running the guest. Each link in the chain a restart has to survive
 * has its own oracle here, because any one of them failing looks like the same empty tab strip:
 *
 * 1. The client's lease reconnects naming a runtime id that no longer exists. The replacement
 *    answers `browser_client_host_authority_mismatch`, which the client must read as "wait for the
 *    successor" rather than as a reason to retire the environment and its live guests.
 * 2. The relaunched runtime holds no page records, so it has to rebuild them from the inventory the
 *    reattaching host reports — asserted against the runtime's own page registry, not the client's.
 * 3. Adoption reissues the page under fresh generations, so the single-row count catches a recovery
 *    that replays the create URL alongside the adopted page.
 * 4. The guest must come back where the user left it, which is why the fixture moves the page before
 *    the restart: on its create URL, restoring correctly and restoring wrongly agree.
