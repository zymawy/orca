 * Every existing reconnect spec reconnects by calling ssh.disconnect() then ssh.connect() — a
 * clean, client-initiated cycle that the client knows is coming. Nothing covered the fault the
 * reconnect machinery actually exists for: the transport dying underneath a live session, with the
 * remote still running and still holding the PTYs.
 *
 * The distinction matters because the two paths diverge at the relay. A graceful disconnect closes
 * the client cleanly; a killed connection leaves the relay's grace window and PTY table intact, so
 * a correct client re-attaches rather than rebuilding. Reports of frozen panes and duplicated agent
 * sessions come from the second shape, which had no coverage at all.
 *
 * Faults come from docker-ssh-relay-faults, in two shapes that must not be confused. Killing
 * sshd's per-connection forks leaves the listening daemon and every relay process alive, so the
 * session survives and the pane must keep its PTY. SIGKILLing the relay leaves sshd reachable but
 * genuinely ends the sessions, so the pane must be replaced. Only the second is `exited`; a suite
 * with only the first cannot tell a resume from a silent cold start
 * (docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md).
