 * removes its own mirror through tab sync. An owner that has forgotten the page does neither, which
 * left the row standing with an inert X and no way to dismiss it.
 *
 * What this pins is the CLIENT-side fallback: the X exits through session.tabs.close, which throws
 * tab_not_found before browserTabClose is ever reached, so the runtime's own ghost retirement never
 * runs here. Do not simplify the client fallback on the strength of this spec -- the server-side
 * retirement is covered by orca-runtime-browser-ghost-session-row-close.test.ts, and neither
