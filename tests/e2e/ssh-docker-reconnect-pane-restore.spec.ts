/**
 * The two regressions this covers both shipped and both reached a user, because nothing here
 * asserted what a pane actually SHOWS after a reconnect:
 *
 * 1. Panes came back blank. The relay treated the reconnecting client as one that already held the
 *    stream and returned no scrollback, while the renderer had disposed the xterm with its buffer.
 * 2. A tab created afterwards came up with no prompt and stayed generically titled, because the
 *    reconnect prepaint could still fire on a spent mount.
 *
 * Reading the pane's own text is the point. Asserting a pty id, a status, or a spy call is what let
 * both of these through: every one of those was correct while the screen was wrong.
 *
 * KNOWN: (1) is fixed at the symptom. requireReplay makes the client ask for what the relay wrongly
 * decided it did not need. Three attempts at the cause failed, and the reasons are worth keeping
 * because each looks correct until you run it:
 *
 * - RETIRING THE DELIVERY ON dispatcher.onClientDetached, the way fs-handler, git-handler and
 *   relay-filesystem-watch-registry release their per-client state, BREAKS CHECKPOINT RECOVERY (10
 *   tests in relay-pty-source-recovery-interleavings / restore-retry). A delivery outliving its
 *   client is deliberate here: it is what lets a reconnecting client resume from a checkpoint
 *   instead of re-receiving everything. This class omits that subscription on purpose.
 * - RETIRING WITHOUT session.cancelDelivery() orphans the credit ledger's one-upstream-owner-per-pty
 *   slot, and the next open throws "PTY source delivery already has an upstream owner". Seen live as
 *   an error toast and a blank pane.
 * - COMPARING record.identity.clientGeneration TO THE REQUEST is not available: that value is
 *   client-supplied through pty.openClient (see admitsPtyDataPublication in
 *   dispatcher-capacity-signals.ts) and RequestContext carries no generation of its own.
 *
 * The real cause is now established, and it is broader than this spec: a reconnect reuses the same
 * clientId (setWrite keeps the primary client), so the relay's activate() matches on it and returns
 * 'existing' before ever reaching the recovery branch. Checkpointed source recovery therefore has
 * never run on an SSH reconnect at all, and the byte tail is not a fallback but the only path. Full
 * chain and the fix it implies: docs/reference/ssh-reconnect-source-recovery.md.
