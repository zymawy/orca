/**
 * Headless end-to-end coverage for Japanese and Chinese terminal input.
 *
 * Three shapes are covered, and the second is the one the whole suite used to be blind to:
 *
 *  1. Phrase-level composition — a Japanese preedit that grows to several characters and converts
 *     to kanji, and a pinyin preedit that spends most of its life as multi-letter romanisation.
 *     Both are asserted on the overlay's real geometry rather than on the bytes they later emit.
 *  2. Committed text that arrives with **no composition session at all**. Full-width punctuation
 *     (`，` `。` `、`) and full-width digits are typed as a single keystroke that the input source
 *     rewrites; there is no compositionstart/update/end around them. Every IME test in the repo
 *     was composition-session-shaped, so this shape was invisible to the suite by construction —
 *     which is how `，` reaching the shell as an ASCII `,` shipped to users. This is the macOS
 *     shape, and the tests for it pin the macOS ownership policy.
 *  3. The same full-width punctuation arriving **inside** a composition session, which is how the
 *     Windows and Linux frameworks deliver it. Same user-facing guarantee, different ordering.
 *
 * The assertion for shapes 2 and 3 is deliberately "the ASCII byte never appears" rather than "the
 * substitution was applied": the correct design never manufactures the ASCII byte in the first
 * place, so pinning its absence stays true under a forwarder rewrite as well as under a
 * structural one.
