/**
 * JOURNEY: two desktop clients paired to one Orca server, working in the same workspace.
 *
 * TOPOLOGY: the `orcaPage` app is the host (orca server). Two separate real Orca desktop
 * clients pair to it, exactly as two of the user's machines would. Nothing is faulted — this
 * is the ordinary shape of using Orca from a laptop and a desktop at the same time.
 *
 * The emptied-workspace tombstone is an explicit `tabsByWorktree[worktreeId] = []` row and it
 * is client-local on the runtime path: it never crosses the wire, so the second client cannot
 * know the first emptied the workspace on purpose and still seeds into it. That asymmetry is
 * by design. What is NOT by design is a client falling out of step with the host and staying
 * there, which is what this spec measures.
 *
 * Phase 0 is the control: with both clients attached, does a terminal created on one reach the
 * other at all? Without it a later divergence cannot be attributed to the emptying.
 *
 * WAS RED, NOW GREEN, AND THE MEASUREMENT IS THE POINT. This spec was written to pin a defect
 * rather than to assert a fix. Across 8 runs on a branch that carried neither of this PR's
 * publish-side changes, the close phases were all-or-nothing: either every retraction reached both
 * clients in single-digit milliseconds, or none reached either client within 90 seconds. Phase 1a,
 * which closes a terminal while others remain open, failed alongside phase 1b, so it was never
 * about the workspace going empty. Creates always propagated, including the phase 2 create landing
 * in ~3ms on the very clients that had just missed a close for 90s, so the subscription was
 * demonstrably alive. Both clients failing together while the host's own window showed the correct
 * count put the fault on the host's publish-after-close, not on any client's mirror.
 *
 * That diagnosis named exactly what this PR changes: `publish a terminal retirement proof on the
 * exit's own evidence` and `a removal retraction is not a publisher handover`. Measured on this
 * branch with both of them present, all phases pass and the close retractions arrive in
 * single-digit to low-hundreds of milliseconds (phase1a A=9ms B=158ms, phase1b A=1ms B=192ms).
 * So this is no longer a pinned defect; it is the end-to-end proof that the unit-level retirement
 * proof actually reaches the wire.
 *
 * If it goes red again, that is a regression in the publish-after-close path and the numbers above
 * are the baseline to compare against — do not skip-tag it. The failure shape to expect is the
 * all-or-nothing one: a 90s timeout on both clients at once, with creates still propagating.
 *
 * Run:
 *   pnpm exec playwright test \
 *     tests/e2e/paired-two-client-emptied-workspace-reseed.spec.ts \
 *     --config tests/playwright.config.ts --project electron-headless --workers=1
