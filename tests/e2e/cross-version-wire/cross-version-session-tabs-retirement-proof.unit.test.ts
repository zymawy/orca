/**
 * The session-tabs retirement-proof surface, paired across two builds.
 *
 * `cross-version-terminal-wire` covers the terminal binary stream and
 * `cross-version-agent-session-wire` covers `agentSession.*`; neither reaches the
 * session-tabs frame, which is where a paired client learns that a mirrored terminal
 * is gone. This pairs the two halves of that surface across versions:
 *
 *  - the HOST half changed — a host now ships a retirement proof on its own frame when
 *    no surface removal carries one (`attachRetirementProofsToSnapshot`);
 *  - the CLIENT half did not change, which this asserts by running both builds' ledger
 *    over the same frames rather than by reading the diff.
 *
 * The claim under test is the one written into the change: that this is Rule 1, because
 * `retiredTerminalSurfaces` is an existing optional field on an existing path. Rule 3's
 * fourth bullet says "a frame the host ... starts sending, on an existing path" is a wire
 * change even with no codec movement, so the claim is checked against an actual old
 * build rather than accepted.
 *
 * The pre-stack ref is pinned rather than derived: this contract needs a release from
 * before the proof-only frame existed, which is the fallback
 * docs/reference/remote-wire-compatibility.md sanctions for exactly this case.
