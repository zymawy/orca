// Cross-version coverage for the structured agent-session surface, paired the same
// way the terminal wire harness is: current code against a real published release.
//
// Three skews matter here, and none can be checked from one build alone — an old
// client must not receive a journal-backed RPC surface it cannot read, a new client
// must find an old host's missing surface cleanly, and a client's cursor must survive
// the host process that minted it.
//
// The session-tabs projection may keep a metadata-only row for an incapable mobile client so the
// chat is not simply absent on the phone. Every `agentSession.*` method and destructive close stays
// refused, which is what the tests below pin; the row-level behaviour is pinned in
// src/main/runtime/rpc/methods/session-tab-agent-status-projection.test.ts.
