/**
 * What the browser said about every request to one origin, for an arm that expected one and did not
 * get it.
 *
 * Every `at` recorded here is Node's `performance.now()`, so `asked` and `attached` can be read
 * against each other and the early-or-late question is answered on one clock. Readings taken inside
 * the frame are on the document's clock and belong beside these, never subtracted from them.
 *
 * Four sources, because each is blind where the others see. `request` fires for what the page asked
 * for at all, which separates a request the policy refused from one nothing ever made.
 * `requestfailed` carries the browser's own `errorText`. CDP's `Network.loadingFailed` adds
 * `blockedReason` and `corsErrorStatus`, which is the only place a refusal names itself when the
 * request never reached the asset listener. `Network.requestWillBeSent` records the resource type, the
 * initiator and the frame, which separates an image the parser found from one nothing asked for.
 *
 * CDP is Chromium's; WebKit has no session to open here, and the two page events carry that engine.
 *
 * Recorded into arrays and formatted only when asked, so an arm that passes pays for the
 * subscription and never for the reading.
