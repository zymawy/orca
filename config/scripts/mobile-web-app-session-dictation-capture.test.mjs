/**
 * Which route closures reach dictation's capture seam, and therefore which routes must be granted
 * the three audio verbs.
 *
 * A census rather than a hand list, because a grant row written by hand is a row that stops
 * agreeing with the closure the moment a screen moves: the rule below reads what each registered
 * page route actually reaches and holds its `grants` to it. It was vacuous when it was written —
 * the session route is the only closure that reaches the seam and the manifest did not carry it —
 * and C7.7 registers that route, so the rule now binds a real entry and the four names in it were
 * taken from this census rather than copied. The control beside it stays: it is what shows the
 * rule failing, which a green rule over a satisfied manifest cannot.
 *
 * The closure also says what the seam took out of the page. Without its web half the bundler
 * resolves the native one, and with it the device module that owns the microphone: the vendored
 * `@orca/expo-two-way-audio` web stub lands in the closure along with `expo-keep-awake` — which is
 * what dictation on the page used to be: a module answering denied microphone permission, and a
 * wake lock that did nothing.
 *
 * Eight vendored modules re-enter that way, five from `@orca/expo-two-way-audio` and three from
 * `expo-keep-awake`. That eight is the number below; absolute module counts are not asserted,
 * because every merge of main moves them and a census that pinned them would fail for reasons that
 * are nobody's.
 *
 * So "absent" here is a fact about the seam and not about the census failing to look, and the
 * precondition is checked rather than assumed: both package names are resolved from the install, so
 * a substring that matches nothing fails as a typo rather than passing as an absence.
