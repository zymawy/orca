 *
 * Its own module, and the boundary `mobile-web-app-preview-frame-readings.mjs` already names: the
 * rig file holds what each case claims, this holds how an arm is driven, and that one holds what a
 * driven arm reports. The three grow for different reasons and were over the 600-line cap together.
 *
 * `rig` is everything the driver cannot build for itself -- the servers and origins the suite
 * started once, the sink refusals are attributed through, the pixel clip, and the nonce counter it
 * advances. Passed rather than imported, because a module-level copy of that state is a second one.
