 * case's whole timeout there -- seven timeouts on one engine, after the same difference had already

 *
 * Every wait below asks in the frame's main world through `pollFrameUntil`, for the reason that
 * module carries: a selector wait needs an isolated world the embedder cannot see fail.
 *
 * Three things still settle at their own moments: React commits the mount, the element's `srcdoc`
 * commits a document, and an override arm replaces that document with a second one. So readiness is
 * the fixture's own marker inside the frame, which exists only once the artifact has parsed there.
 *
 * `frameReady` is which of those an arm is waiting for, because the marker is not always the right
 * one. `'script'` waits for what the inline script writes, on the document element rather than on a
 * window global: the marker element exists from parse time, so an arm whose oracle is "the script
 * ran" would otherwise read the flag before it was written. `'load'` is for the one arm whose
 * artifact deliberately navigates the frame somewhere else, where no marker is ever coming.
 *
 * `reportReady` is the other kind of precondition: a refusal the policy reported to the rig's own
 * server, which an arm about what the policy refused waits for instead of reading a list.
 *
 * `'images'` is the mirror of `reportReady`: an arm whose claim is that the policy admitted two
 * image requests waits for both to have been recorded, rather than reading a count after a clock.
