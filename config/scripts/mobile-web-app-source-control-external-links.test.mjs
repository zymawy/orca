/**
 * What the source-control hub and the diff review page may reach for a URL.
 *
 * Inside the shell's WebView react-native-web's `Linking.openURL` calls
 * `window.open(url, '_blank', 'noopener')`, which both shells refuse — iOS returns nil from
 * `createWebViewWith`, Android false from `onCreateWindow` — and resolves whether or not anything
 * opened. A call site left on that path reports success into a tap that did nothing, which is the
 * one failure the `externalLink` grant exists to remove.
 *
 * Both routes reach the PR sidebar, and the sidebar is where this domain's openers are: a check's
 * "open on the web", a comment's permalink, and a link inside comment Markdown. So both are held
 * to the same rule and neither inherits it from the other.
 *
 * The rule, not the three call sites it happens to have today: a module entering either closure
 * later is held to it without anyone remembering to add it here.

 * `https`, so that path works on one platform and silently not on the other. Both routes copy —
 * the conflict section's refresh commands, and the review sheet's notes — so both are granted
 * `native.clipboard.write` and both must reach it through the seam.
 *
 * Asserted as the module's absence from the closure rather than as a count of importers: a new
 * import anywhere in the tree puts the file back, whoever writes it and whatever they name it.
