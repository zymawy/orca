/**
 * What the source-control hub and the diff review page measure a keyboard with.
 *
 * react-native-web's `Keyboard` is a stub: `addListener` returns a subscription that never fires
 * and `isVisible()` is always false. A module inside the page that waits for `keyboardDidShow`
 * waits for the life of the document, and the software keyboard covers whatever is at the bottom
 * of it — the hub's commit bar and the review note composer, both of which are text entry.
 *
 * So the rule is the seam, not the two call sites it has today: `platform/keyboard-occlusion` is
 * the one module in either closure allowed to name the stub, and it has a `.web.ts` sibling that
 * reads `visualViewport` instead.
