/**
 * The HTML preview's sealed frame, in a real browser under the shipped policy, on both engines.
 *
 * The frame holds an agent-produced artifact inside the page's own document, so every claim about
 * what it cannot do has to be measured rather than reasoned about — and every one of those claims is
 * an absence, which is also what a frame that never rendered reports. So each case runs against a
 * no-header control where the same artifact does the thing: the script runs, the remote subresources
 * are fetched, the navigation happens. Without those controls a preview that failed to load would
 * pass every assertion here.
 *
 * WebKit as well as Chromium, because the iOS shell is WKWebView and the two disagree: a `blob:`
 * frame that Chromium admits under `frame-src blob:` is refused in WebKit by the
 * `frame-ancestors 'none'` it inherits. `srcdoc` is what both admit under the policy that already
 * ships, which is why this costs no CSP change and why a case below pins `frame-src 'none'` as still
 * shipped.
 *
 * The paint oracle is a pixel rather than a read inside the frame: the frame is an opaque origin, and
 * WebKit refuses to evaluate in one, so reading its DOM would make the instrument engine-dependent.

			 * The hide path C8.1 exists for (ruling 37.2), against the same rig that measures the open one.

			 * A shell built before the cancelled-navigation event drops a tapped link in silence, so the
			 * page asks first and renders the artifact's links as text when the answer is no. The ruling
			 * names three readings and all three are taken: no underline, no pointer cursor, no anchor a
			 * tap does nothing on. The granted arm is each one's presence precondition -- without it,
			 * "no underline" is also what a frame that never rendered reports.
			 *
			 * Every verdict here is a reading the frame itself publishes: the anchors its document holds,
			 * the style the engine computed for one, whether focus lands on it, and whether the tap this
			 * arm made landed at all. None of them waits for a record that may never arrive.
			 *
			 * That is the round-1 fix, and it is why this case has two arms rather than three. It had a
			 * third that tapped the granted link and waited for the top-frame navigation through
			 * `expectNavigation: 'main-frame'`, and `waitForRecordedNavigation` has no bound but the
			 * case's own timeout: on CI's Chrome the click missed its 2 s actionability window under load,
			 * no navigation was ever recorded, and the arm sat in that wait for the whole 240 s
			 * (`Test timed out in 240000ms`, recorded `[]`, with the frame attached only at 38.9 s). Three
			 * arms sharing one budget is what made this case the one to find it.
			 *
			 * Nothing is lost by dropping it. The tap's outcome on a granted shell is the next case,
			 * `hands a user's tap on a link to the top frame, exactly once`, on these same counters from
			 * this same rig and with a budget of its own -- so the zero below still has a presence
