 * policy refused from one that was merely slow, which is what CI's chromium timeouts could not say.
 *
 * The reading is sampled while waiting and printed from the last sample, never read at the abort:
 * a reading taken after the case has timed out loses its race with vitest's teardown, which is how
 * a first attempt at this printed nothing at all. Nothing is rethrown either -- a rejection raised
 * after vitest has given up has nobody left to catch it, and an unhandled one fails a run whose

/**
 * Everything a frame that never became ready can still be asked, which is the whole diagnosis when
 * the only oracle is a runner.
 *
 * Three readings, because each is blind where the others see. The element's own attributes come from
 * the embedder and survive a frame that never parsed. `contentDocument` and `contentWindow` answer
 * only for a frame granted `allow-same-origin`, and say `refused` for the opaque ones, which is
 * itself the answer to "is this arm same-origin". And every Playwright frame is evaluated through
 * CDP, which reaches an opaque frame whose own scripts are blocked, so `readyState` separates a
 * document that never parsed from one that parsed and did nothing.
 *
 * The violations are read per frame rather than from the top. `securitypolicyviolation` does not
 * cross frames, so the top document's array says nothing about what the frame refused -- and the
 * page's init script installs the same collector in every frame, measured on both engines, so each
 * frame has its own array to report.
 *
 * `utilityWorld` is the fourth reading, and it is the one the readings above cannot give. Everything
 * else here is an evaluate, which needs only a frame's main context; a selector wait needs the
 * injected script in Chromium's isolated world, created per document by a command whose failure the
 * driver swallows. Three cases once spent their whole timeout in such a wait while an evaluate in
 * the same frame answered, so the probe is bounded and reported rather than left to be inferred
 * again. `unavailable` here and a main-world reading beside it is that split, measured.
