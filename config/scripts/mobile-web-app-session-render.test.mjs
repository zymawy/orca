/**
 * The session route in a real browser, on the bundle the shell would serve, under its own header.
 *
 * What only a browser answers for this route: that every module in the largest closure of the
 * series imports and evaluates under React Native Web, that the route paints the session screen
 * rather than the Unmatched route, that its chunk arrives over the wire on a client-side
 * navigation, and that nothing it paints leaves the origin or violates the policy. The unit tests
 * cannot say any of it, because they mock react-native away — it is Flow source vitest will not
 * parse.
 *
 * Two defects this file found, both invisible natively and both a console line rather than a crash,
 * and both now fixed:
 *
 * - `use-mobile-session-markdown-actions.ts` registered `BackHandler` with no platform guard, and
 *   the effect re-registers whenever the dirty-draft list changes. React Native Web answers with
 *   "BackHandler is not supported on web and should not be used." and an inert subscription: two
 *   lines on the console at mount, and a hardware-back guard never armed anyway.
 * - `use-mobile-session-diff-comments.ts` ran `void loadDiffComments()` in an effect with no catch.
 *   The loader returns on a *refused* `worktree.show` and nothing caught a *rejected* one, so a
 *   host that will not answer raised an unhandled rejection on every session mount. `.catch` at the
 *   effect is the fix, and it moved a golden: the corpus certified the rejection as an effect of the
 *   loaded checkpoint, so `matrix-session.diff-notes-worktree.show-1` was re-recorded without it.
 *
 * So the error assertion below is an exact empty list rather than a filter: nothing from this
 * closure reaches the document, and any error at all reds it.
 *
 * **The terminal is not painted here, and this file must not look as though it is.** Putting a
 * terminal on screen needs the host protocol handshake, a tab snapshot, a terminal inventory and a
 * `terminal.subscribe` stream, which is five hand-written fixtures against five Zod schemas inside
 * a transport double — the thing the harness's own docstring says it must not become. What the
 * terminal does under the shipped header, opening xterm with zero CSP violations and a byte-exact
 * transcript, is `mobile-web-app-terminal-render.test.mjs`, which drives the same component on the
 * same build options through a probe route. The rest of what this file does not claim is at the
 * bottom.

/**
 * What this file does not claim, and where each is answered instead.
 *
 * **The terminal.** No terminal is attached here, for the reason in the header: the screen paints
 * "Loading tabs" against a double that answers no RPC. `mobile-web-app-terminal-render.test.mjs`
 * is the browser proof of the terminal itself — xterm opening under `script-src 'self'`, an
 * escape-dense byte stream read back through the document's own selection path, zero CSP
 * violations — and it drives the same component through a probe route because a session screen
 * cannot reach one without the whole host protocol scripted.
 *
 * **The chat, the pickers and the clipboard.** Each is behind a control that only renders once the
 * screen has provider data, which is the same wall C4's render check names. They are pinned by the
 * source censuses beside them (`mobile-web-app-session-external-links.test.mjs`,
 * `mobile-web-app-session-media-picker.test.mjs`) and by the host and port-pair suites.
 *
 * **The browser pane.** `mobile-web-app-browser-pane-render.test.mjs` drives it with real frames;
 * what this route owes it is the `screencastBinary` grant, which
 * `mobile-web-app-screencast-lane-grant.test.mjs` derives from this closure.
 *
 * **The storage refusals a control makes.** The case above covers the writes a mount makes on its
 * own; a refusal a user's own write earns still needs the control. That chain is
 * `mobile/src/session/mobile-structured-send-page-storage-refusal.test.ts` end to end over the
 * real `page-async-storage`.
