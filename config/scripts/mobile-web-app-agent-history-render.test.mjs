 * `transport-host-status-gates-ready` — which is the same shape the readers were built against. Authoring them here is how a fixture ends up wrong in a way the screen tolerates: a
 * locked-terminal reply written by hand in the seam test resolved instead of throwing, because the
 * flag it set was one level off the shape the reader reads.
 *
 * `wt-history` and `/repo/feature` travel together for the same reason. The panel opens on the
 * `workspace` scope and derives its filter paths from the worktree list, so the session is in scope
 * only when the route's worktree is the one whose path is the session's `cwd`. Opened on any other
