/**
 * Every Windows-gated test file must be registered in BOTH Windows-lane lists.
 *
 * PR CI has exactly one job on a Windows runner -- asserted below on any
 * `runs-on` spelling that could land there, because that premise is what makes
 * this guard meaningful -- and it runs a curated explicit file list. Everything else runs on `ubuntu-latest`, where a Windows-gated
 * suite self-skips and reports success. So a new Windows-gated file that nobody
 * registers executes on no machine and passes green, silently. A recent
 * security effort added six such files; five ran nowhere, including one whose
 * whole point was asserting a native addon's bytes no longer contain a flagged
 * primitive. Registering the instances did not hold -- a sixth arrived from
 * unrelated work while the first five were being fixed -- so the class needs a
 * guard.
 *
 * Both lists matter and being in one is not enough: `WINDOWS_PACKAGE_TESTS` in
 * pr-code-change-scope.mjs decides whether the `package_windows` job RUNS at
 * all for a diff, and the workflow step's vitest argv decides whether the FILE
 * runs once the job started.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DETECTS -- a file is Windows-gated when its name is `*.win32.test.*`
 * / `*.win32.spec.*`, or when it contains ANY suite-level gate, nested ones
 * included, spelled:
 *   - `describe.runIf(<true only on win32>)`, `describe.skipIf(<false only on win32>)`
 *   - `const d = <true only on win32> ? describe : describe.skip`, and the
 *     `? describe.skip : describe` inversion
 * where the condition is `process.platform === 'win32'` / `!== 'win32'`, a
 * compound `<win32 check> && <anything>`, or a `const`/`let` in the same file
 * assigned from either -- so `const RUN_REAL = platform === 'win32' && env…`
 * used as `describe.runIf(RUN_REAL)` is detected, whatever the flag is named
 * and whichever polarity it was written in. Quote style, spacing and the
 * `describe`/`suite` spelling are tolerated. Nested gates count because the
 * Windows lane runs whole files: a win32-only block buried three levels down
 * still runs on no machine unless the file is registered.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT DETECT -- known blind spots, each deliberate:
 *   - `it`/`test`-level gates. A single win32-only case inside a cross-platform
 *     suite still leaves the file running its other cases on ubuntu, and
 *     pulling all such files -- about thirty, though the figure moves with
 *     which gate spellings you count, so do not lean on it -- into the serial
 *     Windows job is not the trade CI wants. This is the largest limit, and it
 *     is a policy choice, not an oversight: a suite-level gate means a whole
 *     block exists only for Windows, which is the shape worth a lane entry.
 *   - a gate whose condition crosses a module boundary or a function call --
 *     an imported flag, an imported `describeOnWindows`, `isWindows()`.
 *     `legacy-wsl-runtime-auth-drain-apply-script.test.ts` imports its
 *     `isWindows`; it happens to be a POSIX-only gate, so nothing is missed
 *     today, but a win32-only one written that way would be.
 *   - `runIf(<win32> || <x>)` and `skipIf(<not win32> && <x>)` are rejected on
 *     purpose: both can run off Windows, so neither is a win32-only gate. That
 *     holds whether the condition is written at the gate or routed through a
 *     named flag -- the two spellings used to disagree.
 *   - whether a registered suite EXECUTES. Registration is what is asserted. A
 *     suite gated on win32 plus an env var stays skipped on the CI runner even
 *     when registered -- see MANUAL_OPT_IN -- and a path registered but gated
 *     for another platform is not caught either.
 *   - whether the `package_windows` job is triggered for a given diff, or
 *     whether the registered test asserts anything worth running.
 *
 * Growth of the two grandfathered lists is capped by literals, but only review
 * stops someone raising a cap. The caps make that an explicit, visible edit.
