 * #22072 removed it.
 *
 * Two counts, and which one a row takes is what its sentence is about. Exactly one row takes the
 * intersection: the `.mjs` sentence for how many of the session route's grants these rows cover,
 * which a row pinning a grant no route declares -- the shell can serve a verb before a screen asks
 * for it -- would otherwise make the census demand a comment overstate the session route's list.
 *
 * Of the rows that could take either, every other one counts the rows here, the title about
 * reaching them through the session route included. That title names the session route but is not
 * a claim about it: the assertion under it compares `grantsNeeded` with every row's grants, so it
 * has to move when the rows move and not when the route does. A census holding it at the
 * intersection would have kept the title below the assertion it heads. The remaining rows count
 * neither: they read the route's own list, or the grants on it that no row pins.
 *
 * The rows read the whole file, titles included: a count in a JSDoc and the same count in an `it`
 * title go stale together, and pinning only the first leaves a green suite describing itself
 * wrongly to whoever reads the run.
