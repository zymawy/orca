/**
 * What the session screen may reach to pick media, which is what its media grants are declared
 * against.
 *
 * The route is not registered yet (C7.7 registers it), so this walks the route module's own closure
 * rather than a page route's. The bundler resolves it exactly as it would a registered one — a
 * `.web.ts` sibling wins — so the modules judged here are the ones the page would run.
 *
 * `expo-image-picker` and `expo-document-picker` throw at import in a browser and the manifest
 * imports every route, so one of them in this closure is the whole bundle down rather than one
 * picker; `expo-clipboard`'s `getImageAsync` resolves instead to a `navigator.clipboard` read
 * needing a secure context, which the iOS shell's custom scheme is not.
