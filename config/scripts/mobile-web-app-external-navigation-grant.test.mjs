/**
 * Which page routes render an HTML artifact, and the grant the preview needs from each of them.
 *
 * Natively the preview is its own WebView and `onShouldStartLoadWithRequest` hands every request to
 * `openExternalLink`, so there is nothing to negotiate. In the page a tap inside the sealed frame
 * becomes a top-frame navigation, and only the shell around the document can cancel it and open the
 * URL. A shell built before that event drops the navigation in silence, so
 * `use-html-preview-link-grant.web.ts` asks first (`init.grants.native`) and a route that declared
 * nothing renders the artifact's links as text.
 *
 * `externalNavigation` has no call site of the shape `mobile-web-app-page-grant-call-sites.mjs`
 * parses -- nothing is requested and nothing is answered, so there is no seam function to find --
 * which is why it belongs here beside `haptics` and `screencastBinary` rather than as a row there.
 * The screencast census's shape, against the third token that is neither a verb nor a notify.
 *
 * The lane is optional, so what this census pins is different from the required-lane ones: a route
 * missing the grant is not a native screen, it is a preview with inert links. That makes the
 * declaration easy to forget, and this is the only thing that would notice.
