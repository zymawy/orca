/**
 * What the two files pages may reach for a URL and for the clipboard, which is what their grants
 * are declared against.
 *
 * Inside the shell's WebView react-native-web's `Linking.openURL` calls `window.open(url, '_blank')`,
 * which both shells refuse and which resolves whether or not anything opened, so a call site left on
 * that path reports success into a tap that did nothing.
 *
 * Both routes declare `externalLink`, for different reasons, and this file holds each to its own.
 * The preview renders Markdown and reaches the seam through `MobileMarkdown`, a consumer inside the
 * domain. The explorer has no such consumer — its only reach is the shared host layout, which every
 * page route reaches and which the worktree list declares nothing for — and declares the grant
 * because its rows push to the preview in-page, under the session the explorer opened.
