 * A real TLS origin for the artifact's images, because interception could not measure them.
 *
 * The rig used to answer `https://…invalid` through Playwright's route interception. On Chrome 152
 * the sandboxed `srcdoc` frame is isolated into its own target, and the parser-inserted `<img>` is
 * the first fetch the document makes -- earlier than interception is attached to that target. The
 * request escaped to the real network, `.invalid` did not resolve, and the rig recorded nothing
 * while the document's own resource timing showed the fetch. A listener that is already accepting
 * before the page is created cannot be raced that way: the request either arrives or it does not,
 * and either answer is the measurement.
 *
 * `img-src 'self' data: https:` matches on scheme, so `https://127.0.0.1:<port>` exercises the same
 * directive any other https host would.
