/**
 * What a page's taps reach for a haptic, and the grant every page route needs to get one.
 *
 * Inside the shell's WebView `expo-haptics` fakes an iOS haptic by clicking a hidden checkbox it
 * appends to `document.head`, which is what killed a long press on the worktree list (C1.9). So the
 * page's seam posts `native.haptics.trigger` instead and the app plays the device's own — and a
 * route that imports the seam without declaring `haptics` is a page whose taps go quiet, because
 * grants are resolved once from the route the shell opened.
 *
 * The scan has a control rather than an empty list: the same walk over the native sibling finds the
 * same five functions and no posting site, which is what says it can tell the two apart.
