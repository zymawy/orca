/**
 * Mermaid rendered in the page, in a real browser, under the policy the shell ships.
 *
 * The native component seals an untrusted diagram inside a `WebView` whose document embeds the
 * whole engine as a string. The page has no second content process, so what replaces it is
 * `import('mermaid')` on demand and mermaid's own `securityLevel: 'strict'` output. That makes
 * three claims this file measures rather than asserts: that rendering violates no directive and
 * asks for no JIT, that what the page paints is the diagram the phone already paints, and that a
 * hostile diagram reaches the document inert.
 *
 * The equality oracle is the native `buildHtml` itself, bundled and served as its own document in
 * the same browser. Two differences survive and are normalised away: the diagram id (mermaid's own
 * `mermaid-<epoch>` on the native path, the component's `useId` on the page) and the `xmlns:xlink`
 * declaration the native document's `innerHTML` serialization adds. Everything else — the viewBox,
 * the `max-width`, the injected `<style>`'s rules — is compared byte for byte.
 *
 * Both engines, because the shell is WKWebView on one platform and a Chromium WebView on the
 * other, and "does mermaid need eval" is answered by the engine rather than by mermaid.
 *
 * Recorded from this file's own run, for whoever needs the trade. Rendering one `graph TD` fetches
 * one chunk of 3,482,965 minified bytes on top of a 283,956-byte entry — the pre-bundled engine,
 * not in the entry, and not fetched at all by a page with no diagram on it (ruling 28's fence,
 * held in `mobile-web-app-session-terminal-closure.test.mjs`). One chunk rather than the 103 that
 * `import('mermaid')` emitted: mermaid splits along its own lazy diagram-type boundaries, all of
 * which sit inside the generation the phone has already downloaded, so that split moved no bytes
 * and spent 103 of the 256 manifest assets the shell will load. The native document pays 3,705,846
 * bytes of engine string instead, in the closure, on every mount.
 *
 * The SVG itself: 17,143 bytes on the page against 17,504 in the native document (chromium; webkit
 * is 8 longer on each side), equal at 15,447 once normalised. The gap is the id string repeated
 * across 57 selectors, and dropping `xmlns:xlink` is load-bearing rather than cosmetic — the
 * comparison fails without it.
