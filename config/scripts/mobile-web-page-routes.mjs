/**
 * The screens this desktop asks a phone's shell to render from the app bundle instead of natively.
 *
 * One entry per route proved on the web, and the list is deliberately short: a route that is not
 * here renders the native screen, which is the state every phone is already in. Adding one is a
 * product decision with a device proof behind it, not a consequence of the bundle happening to
 * contain the module.
 *
 * `grants` names what the screen needs the shell to do for it. A shell that implements fewer than
 * an entry names renders the native screen for that route, so writing a grant here before the app
 * that implements it ships costs nothing and breaks nothing.
 *
 * Declared here rather than in src/shared because the builder is the only thing that reads it: the
 * shape it must satisfy is MobileWebBundleRouteSchema, which the manifest write is checked against.
 *
 * `haptics` is on every entry below, and by measurement rather than by habit: the shared worktree
 * row is in all five closures and calls the seam, so a route without the grant is a page whose taps
 * stop buzzing. mobile-web-app-haptics-seam.test.mjs derives that list from the closures and fails
 * on a route that imports the seam and declares nothing.
 *
 * `optionalGrants` names what a screen is better with and complete without (ruling 37). A shell that
 * implements fewer than an entry's `grants` renders the native screen; a shell that implements fewer
 * than its `optionalGrants` renders the page and the page hides that one affordance. So the two
 * lanes are a product decision about the screen: a capability the screen cannot be shown without
 * goes above, and one an author can point at a complete screen without goes below.

	// notify the shell refuses, with nothing on screen to say why.
	{ pathname: '/h/[hostId]', grants: ['navigate', 'storage', 'externalLink', 'haptics'] },
	// Agent session history. `navigate` because a resumed session opens the session screen, which is
	// native, and because the list above now reaches this one without leaving the page. `storage`
	// because the host layout above every page route reads the app's own sidebar width.
	// `externalLink` for that same layout's wall, which is this route's only opener too.

	// Tasks. `navigate` for the session screens its rows open and for the Back that pops the native
	// stack; `storage` for the shared components it renders; `externalLink` for the provider links
	// in its items, checks and drawers; `native.clipboard.write` for the two copy actions in its
	// comment review. Grants are scoped per route, so naming fewer here serves fewer.
	{
		pathname: '/h/[hostId]/tasks',
		grants: ['navigate', 'storage', 'externalLink', 'haptics', 'native.clipboard.write']
	},
	// The file explorer. `navigate` because its Back pops the native stack. `storage` for the shared
	// components the host layout renders above it.
	//
	// `externalLink` is the layout wall's here, the single opener the census finds in this closure:
	// nothing the explorer itself renders opens a URL. It is also inherited, and that is what makes
	// the hop below cheap: a row opens the preview, and because that is a page route and this list
	// covers what it declares, the handoff keeps that push inside this document.
	// Grants are resolved once, from the route the shell opened (`grantsForRoute` on
	// `session.routePathname`), so a preview reached that way runs under *this* route's grants for
	// the life of the session. Covering the preview is therefore what buys the cheap in-document hop,
	// not what makes it correct: a target this list did not cover would be handed to the shell and
	// reopened under its own grants instead. The census beside it reads that relation off this list.
	//
	// The sidebar `HostScreen` the layout renders on a wide layout pushes to `/h/<id>/tasks` from
	// every page route, and no other route declares the `native.clipboard.write` that one asks for.
	// The handoff gives that hop to the shell rather than keeping it here, which is why this list
	// does not grow a grant it has no screen for.

	// The file preview. Same three. `externalLink` has a consumer inside the domain as well as the
	// shared wall every `/h` route carries: a Markdown preview renders links and `MobileMarkdown`
	// opens them through the platform seam. That second site is what the census finds here and not in
	// the explorer, which declares the same list for the wall and for the hop into this route.

	// The source-control hub. `navigate` because its Back pops the native stack and its changed-file
	// rows push review; `storage` for the shared components the host layout renders above it;
	// `externalLink` for the three link openers in the PR segment — the checks list, the comment
	// markdown and the comment card; `native.clipboard.write` for the conflict section's copy button.
	//
	// `pr` and `history` are not listed and never will be. Both are `Redirect`s into this route, so
	// listing one would put a redirect inside a page whose session stays bound to the pathname it
	// left; left native they replace into this route and its switch opens the page once. The hop
	// census sees them as call sites naming `source-control`, never as targets of their own.

	// `externalLink` for the same PR sidebar, reached here through `MobileDiffReviewScreenView`;
	// `native.clipboard.write` for the send sheet's copy-notes action.
	//
	// Equal to the hub's on purpose rather than by coincidence. The two push into each other, and a
	// target declaring no more than its opener is a hop the handoff keeps inside the document — which
	// is why registering them together is what buys the cheap hop, and why the census beside this
	// list would show it the moment either grew a grant the other lacks.

	// The session screen: terminal and chat. Thirteen grants, every one of them read off a call site
	// in this route's own closure rather than carried from the design, and it is the only route that
	// asks for the media verbs, the audio verbs or the screencast lane.
	//
	// `navigate` for the Back that pops the native stack and for the seven handoff sites its panels
	// push from; `storage` for the nine exact keys this route added to `page-storage-keys.ts` and the
	// two workspace-scoped ones beside them; `externalLink` for the six openers it reaches —
	// a terminal link tap whose open mode is the phone's browser, the Markdown and file readers, and
	// the PR segment it docks; `haptics` for twenty-four trigger sites, which is the most of any
	// route. `native.clipboard.write` has six call sites (the quick-command row, the sheets, the diff
	// note, the Markdown actions, the accessory selection, the PR conflict list) and
	// `native.clipboard.read` three (the accessory selection, the terminal's paste, the attachment
	// probe): this screen is the heaviest clipboard user in the app and the first route to need the
	// read as well as the write.
	//
	// The three media verbs are one seam, `useMediaPicker`, reached from the image attachment and the
	// chat's image upload. They are declared together because `canPickMedia` is
	// `pick && read && release` — a picked image is a handle, then chunks, so a route holding fewer
	// than all three can start a pick it cannot finish.
	//
	// `screencastBinary` is C6's, and this is the route C6 ruling 3 deferred it to: the browser pane
	// is mounted by `MobileSessionActiveContent`, and `use-browser-binary-screencast-grant.web.ts`
	// asks the shell through the grants `init` carried. Without it the pane subscribes without
	// `wantsBinary` against a shell that would have encoded the frames.
	//
	// The three audio verbs are dictation's, and they are this route's alone: C7.10 PR D put the
	// capture seam on the page and `mobile-web-app-session-dictation-capture.test.mjs` derives the
	// list from the closure, which reaches `dictation-capture.web.ts` from the composer. All three or
	// none — a route granted two opens a microphone it has no verb to close, and the device side
	// holds the screen awake for as long as one is open (#22072 moved that lock off the page, which
	// is why the fourth verb this list carried is gone). Ruling 4's degradation is retired with them:
	// the page no longer falls back to the vendored module's denied microphone.
	//
	// `externalNavigation` is the one optional grant in this list, and it is C8.1's. The HTML preview
	// renders an agent's artifact in a sealed frame, and a tap on a link inside it becomes a top-frame
	// navigation only the shell can cancel and open. Without the grant the preview renders the
	// artifact with its links as text: the document paints, the Preview/Source toggle works, and
	// nothing offers a tap that does nothing (ruling 37.2). Required would have taken this whole
	// screen native on every shell built before the cancelled-navigation event, which is the trade the
	// optional lane exists to avoid. `mobile-web-app-external-navigation-grant.test.mjs` derives the
	// route list from the closure that calls the hook.
