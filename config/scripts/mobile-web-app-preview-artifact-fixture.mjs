 * so this is the file the bundle ships. `renderSource` is a marker the Source case looks for.
 *
 * Wrapped in the page's own provider because the preview asks the shell what it may do
 * (`use-html-preview-link-grant.web.ts` reads `init.grants.native`), and `usePageBridgeClient`
 * throws outside one. The client is the two members that read is made of and nothing else: a fuller
 * fake would be a second implementation of the bridge, and what an arm needs to vary is the grant
 * list. `grants` defaults to carrying `externalNavigation`, which is what the session route
 * declares, so an arm that does not mention it measures the shipped screen.
