/**
 * Where the preview rig learns that the policy refused something: from the browser's own report,
 * not from a listener inside the frame.
 *
 * The in-frame collector is a page init script, and it can only report what it was present for. In
 * a frame with no `allow-scripts` it observes nothing at all -- the array is there and stays empty
 * while the policy refuses the artifact's image, measured on both engines -- and on CI's Chrome it
 * intermittently missed the `script-src` refusal of a widened frame while catching that same
 * frame's later `img-src` one. A report is sent by the browser itself, so nothing has to have been
 * listening in time, and it arrives for the sealed frame too.
 *
 * Keyed by the arm's nonce, which the document carries in its own URL: every mount loads
 * `/preview?n=<nonce>` and the policy that document is served names `/csp-report?n=<nonce>`, so a
 * report is attributable to the arm that caused it even though a `srcdoc` frame has no URL of its
 * own to name.
 *
 * `report-uri` is additive. It says where a report is sent and changes nothing about what the policy
 * enforces, and the rig pins that by asserting the served directives are the shipped text apart from
 * the one appended here.
