/**
 * What the render fixture gives back when it never finishes starting.
 *
 * The handle is the only way to close it, so a setup that throws before returning one leaves the
 * caller nothing to call: `afterAll` has no fixture, and the listening socket and the scratch tree
 * stay where they are. The socket is the part that bites — an open server handle keeps the vitest
 * worker alive after its last test has reported, so the file hangs rather than failing.
 *
 * The browser is the step that fails in practice and the last one taken, so by then everything
 * else is allocated. It is made to fail the way it actually does, by pointing the launch at an
 * executable that is not there, rather than by standing a double in front of Playwright.
