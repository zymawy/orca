/**
 * Every line on which a module reaches react-native's own `Linking`, by name or through a
 * namespace import.
 *
 * Parsed rather than matched: a regex over the text names `Linking` inside a comment that talks
 * about it and inside a string that quotes it, and a census that reports a line nobody can act on
 * is one the next reader learns to ignore. The parser also settles the quote styles for free.
 *
 * A named import reports the import statement, once however many times the module calls through
 * it, because the import is the thing the rule is about and the thing that has to go. The imported
 * name is what counts, not the local one: `import { Linking as NativeLinking }` is the same import
 * spelled differently, and reading only the binding let it through.
 *
 * A namespace import reports its uses instead, there being no single line to name — `import * as RN
 * from 'react-native'` is not itself an offence — and every alias is read, because a module may
 * import the namespace twice and call on either. A default import is read the same way: this
 * project's interop settings accept `import RN from 'react-native'` (checked with tsc), so it is a
 * binding the whole namespace hangs off exactly as `* as RN` is.
 *
 * A re-export is reported at the export statement. `export { Linking } from 'react-native'` puts
 * the name back in reach of anything that imports this module, and so does `export *`, which
 * carries it along with everything else; the statement is the line to delete, exactly as an import
 * is.
 *
 * Lines rather than a boolean because a red census that names `path:line` is read once, and one
 * that names a file is grepped for. The boolean below is derived from this, so there is one rule.
 *
 * `fileName` decides the script kind, and the default is only for callers holding a source with no
 * path. In a `.ts` file `const id = <T>(value: T) => value` is a generic arrow; parsed as TSX it is
 * an unclosed JSX element, and everything after it — a later `RN.Linking.openURL` included — is
 * swallowed into the error node and never walked.
