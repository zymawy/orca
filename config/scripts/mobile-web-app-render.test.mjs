/**
 * What `useRouteHandoff().back()` rests on, measured in a browser rather than assumed.
 *
 * The handoff keeps a back this document can serve and hands the rest to the shell, and it asks
 * expo-router's `canGoBack()` which of the two it is holding. That answer is React Navigation's
 * (`expo-router/build/global-state/routing.js` returns `navigationRef.current.canGoBack()`), so it
 * is a fact about a mounted tree in a browser and no unit test can settle it.
 *
 * Read through `router.back()` rather than through `canGoBack()` directly, because the page exposes
 * no handle to call it on and a global added for a test is a surface the shipped page would carry
 * forever. `goBack()` queues React Navigation's `GO_BACK`, which is exactly what `canGoBack()`
 * gates: a Back that moves the page proves the answer was true, one that does not proves it was
 * false. `/h/[hostId]/edit` is the call site — a real route of this tree whose chevron is
 * expo-router's own `back()`, which is what the handoff falls through to.
 *
 * The first case is the presence precondition for the two below it. A tap that moved nothing and a
 * tap that never reached a handler look identical on the document, so one tap on this same screen
 * family is asserted to reach the shell before any absence is read as an answer.
