 * demand" about anything (ruling 28). This walks the emitted chunks instead, from the output the
 * route's own module landed in, and follows only `import-statement` edges — which is exactly where
 * a dynamic import stops being part of the download.
 *
 * Both halves come back, because the interesting claim is always a difference: `staticInputs` is
 * what the route costs to open, `deferredInputs` is everything else the bundle emitted, and a
 * module absent from the first is only meaningful while it is present in the second.
