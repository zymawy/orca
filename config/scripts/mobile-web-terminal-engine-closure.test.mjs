/**
 * The 612 KiB xterm engine string, and where the page must never meet it.
 *
 * `terminal-webview-engine.generated.ts` is one minified IIFE of xterm plus two addons, built to
 * be injected into the WebView's HTML document as text. On the page the same engine arrives as an
 * import, so the string is 610 KiB of dead weight — the largest single module in the session
 * route's closure, and unusable there besides, because the shell's CSP has `script-src 'self'`
 * and no nested frame to load a document into.
 *
 * Nothing stops it entering: the module the document's `<style>` needs exported the engine string
 * beside it, so one import of the CSS would have pulled the whole thing in. The CSS is now its own
 * generated artifact and this is the fence. The document's modules are the entry set, because they
 * are what the page imports; the plant below is what says the walk would notice.
