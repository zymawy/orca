 * `Linking` left in it, by `mobile-web-app-tasks-external-links.test.mjs`; the verb end to end,
 * by the host and port-pair suites. A tap-level proof needs provider replies lifted from the
 * recorded corpus, the way the agent-history check lifts its session list, and belongs with the
 * device proof rather than here.
