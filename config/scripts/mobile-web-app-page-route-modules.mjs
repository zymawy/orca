/**
 * The route module behind each declared page route, which is what a closure is read from.
 *
 * `MOBILE_WEB_PAGE_ROUTES` names URL patterns and the bundler walks files, so something has to
 * join the two. Shared rather than restated in each census for the reason
 * `mobile-web-app-external-link-seam.mjs` is: a second copy is a list that stops growing when the
 * first one does, and every census over it goes quietly green on a route nobody added.
 *
 * Extensionless is deliberate on neither side: the `.tsx` is named because that is the file on
 * disk, and the builder's own `resolveExtensions` picks the `.web.tsx` sibling ahead of it exactly
 * as it would for the page.
 *
 * `pageRouteModulesCoverTheManifest` is the guard that holds this map to the manifest; every
 * census that reads it asserts that too, so a route registered without a row here is a route no
 * closure census reads.
