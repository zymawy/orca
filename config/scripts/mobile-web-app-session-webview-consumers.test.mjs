/**
 * What still reaches `react-native-webview` in the session closure, named one module at a time.
 *
 * On the web that package renders the line "React Native WebView does not support this platform"
 * where its consumer was, so a page does not go down over one — but nothing it was mounted for
 * works either, and the closure pays for a module that cannot do its job.
 *
 * C7.6 gave the two editors the plain states they already degrade to (`rulings-ota-c7.md` ruling
 * 8) and left the terminal listed as the work remaining, which was C7.5's. C7.5 has done it: the
 * page mounts xterm in the document and drops the engine string, so the list is now empty and
 * this closure reaches that package from nowhere at all.
 *
 * An empty list is also what a scan that read nothing reports, so the control below no longer
 * uses the list — it runs the same walk over the four native modules that do import the package and
 * over the four web siblings that replace them. The diagram is the fourth: its native component
 * seals untrusted source in a `WebView` and its sibling renders the same diagram in the document
 * (C7.10 item B), which is the same substitution the other three are.
