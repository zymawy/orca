/**
 * The two C4 page routes in a real browser, in the shape of the tasks and files checks.
 *
 * What only a browser answers for these: that every module in either closure imports and evaluates
 * under React Native Web, that the route paints its own screen rather than the Unmatched route, and
 * that each one's chunk arrives over the wire on a client-side navigation. The unit tests cannot say
 * any of it, because they mock react-native away — it is Flow source vitest will not parse.
 *
 * The image policy is the other thing only a browser answers: that the header the shells send is
 * the one this bundle is served under, and that neither route leaves the origin for anything while
 * it paints.
 *
 * **The avatar skip is not proved here, and this file must not look as though it is.** `img-src` is
 * `'self' data:` (rulings-ota-c4.md ruling 3), which is why `PRCommentCard` renders its empty-avatar
 * `View` on web instead of letting one `<Image>` per comment attempt a fetch the policy refuses —
 * but no comment card renders on either of these pages, because the PR chain the bottom of this file
 * names is not scripted. An assertion here that no avatar host was requested passed with the
 * platform check deleted, measured: 5 passed either way. It is gone rather than dressed up, and the
 * only proof of that branch is
 * `mobile/src/components/pr-sidebar/pr-comment-card-web-avatar.test.tsx`, which reds when the check
 * is removed.
 *
 * What survives is a property of these two closures rather than of that component: nothing either
 * route paints reaches off-origin, and nothing it paints violates the policy.
 *
 * What this file deliberately does not claim is at the bottom.

/**
 * What this file does not claim, and where each is answered instead.
 *
 * **The PR surfaces below the trigger.** `MobilePRSidebar`, its comment cards and the `RightDrawer`
 * they sit in need `github.prForBranch` and `github.prComments` to answer, and the review queue
 * needs `worktree.show`, `repo.list` and `repo.baseRefDefault` on top of `git.status` — measured on
 * this tree by driving the page with the double. Scripting that chain would put five hand-written
 * fixtures against five Zod schemas into a transport double, which is the thing the harness's own
 * docstring says it must not become. So neither the comment avatar nor the drawer is exercised on
 * this page at all: the avatar's branch is the component test named in the header. The drawer's
 * scroll behavior belongs with the device proof, which reaches a real PR.
 *
 * **The seams.** The external-link, clipboard and router seams this series moved are each reached
 * from a control that only renders once the screens have provider data, for the same reason. They
 * are pinned by the source censuses beside them and by the host and port-pair suites.
