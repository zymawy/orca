/**
 * Every text input the session screen reaches, and the size it declares.
 *
 * iOS zooms the page on focus of any input under 16px and does not zoom back out, so the document
 * spends the rest of that typing session at a scale other than 1 — which `keyboard-occlusion.web.ts`
 * reads as "not a keyboard" on purpose, because geometry cannot separate a zoom from a keyboard.
 *
 * This closure is the one that cannot afford it. The terminal's own input is a hidden field the
 * keyboard seam's geometry is the whole basis of, and this screen reaches nine inputs that declare
 * a size — a custom-key capture field, a prompt modal, the chat's ask/composer/question fields, the
 * quick-command editor and its search, and the terminal command bar. One of them left off the seam
 * leaves every later focus on this screen measuring a zoomed document.
 *
 * The rule is the closure rather than the nine sites it happens to have today: a module entering it
 * later is held to it without anyone remembering to add it here.
