/**
 * The push subsystem, and why no page route may reach any part of it.
 *
 * Not `runtime-capability-probe.ts`, which `push-registration.ts` also imported. The session route
 * reaches it through `use-mobile-session-tab-reconciliation.ts`, and there it works: it sends
 * `status.get`, a read with no client identity that the shell forwards like any non-`native.`
 * request (`bridge-host-requests.ts`) and the desktop's mobile allowlist admits. Its other importer,
 * `codex-reset-credit-capability.ts`, hangs off `app/h/[hostId]/accounts.tsx`, which the bundle
 * carries and the page never serves: it hands `/accounts` to the native screen. It left the C1
 * layout closure with push and stayed in the bundle, which is why it is pinned nowhere here.
 *
 * `expo-notifications` first, and why no page route may import it.
 *
 * It is not a module a browser can merely import. `DevicePushTokenAutoRegistration.fx` runs at
 * import: it adds a push-token listener, which React Native Web answers with a warning and an inert
 * subscription, and it reads the persisted server registration out of `window.localStorage`. That
 * read is guarded by `typeof localStorage === 'undefined'`, and the Android shell's WebView has DOM
 * storage off, where `window.localStorage` is `null` rather than undefined — so the guard passes
 * and the read raises "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getItem')". The emulator run saw
 * both lines on every page load, the second at error level, from a subsystem the page cannot use:
 * push registration needs a device token the shell owns and a gateway the page has no client for.
 *
 * Two modules imported it — `push-token.ts` and `desktop-notification-channel.ts`, both reached
 * through `push-registration.ts`, which `app/h/_layout.tsx` pulled in via the host screen's remove
 * action. Both were given `.web` siblings. That was the first fence, and it is kept because
 * nothing else stops a third importer: every call in those two files was already inert on web, so
 * a page that imports one behaves correctly and still loads the package.
 *
 * `push-registration.ts` is fenced a layer up, and that is what the assertions below read. The
 * page cannot register for push at all: it has no device token and no gateway client, so every
 * path through that module either does nothing or writes `orca:remotePushHostRegistrations`
 * through a page storage adapter that drops the write and says so. `host-removal-lifecycle.web.ts`
 * is what cut it out — removing a host is native-only — and it took the whole of
 * `src/notifications` with it, because that import was the only path into the directory from any
 * page route. So the fence is stated as the directory rather than as three module names: the two
 * `.web` siblings above are no longer in the page bundle either, and a test that asserted their
 * presence as its precondition would now be asserting the fence had a hole.
