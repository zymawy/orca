/**
 * Which page routes mount the browser pane, and the grant the pane needs from each of them.
 *
 * Natively the socket carries the screencast's binary frames and the app is both halves of that
 * path, so there is nothing to negotiate. In the page the frames come through a shell that may
 * predate the encoder, and the pane asks first: `use-browser-binary-screencast-grant.web.ts` reads
 * `init.grants.native`, and a route that did not declare `screencastBinary` subscribes without
 * `wantsBinary` — a live pane on a stream no frame arrives on, with nothing on screen to say why.
 *
 * C6 could not write this census: the pane is mounted by a route rather than registered as one, so
 * there was no route to pin the grant against (C6 ruling 3 deferred it to C7). The session route is
 * that route, and this is the general rule rather than an entry for it — the haptics seam census's
 * shape, against the other grant a shared component brings into a closure.
