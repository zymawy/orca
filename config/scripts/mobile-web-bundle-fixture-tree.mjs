/**
 * A small, real bundle tree for the suites that test the packaging guard rather than the page.
 *
 * The guard reads a manifest and the bytes beside it; what those bytes are is not its business.
 * Building the app bundle to get them would make every one of those cases pay for esbuild over
 * the whole mobile graph, and would fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the guard on any
 * machine where mobile's dependencies are absent.
 *
 * Real rather than hand-written: it goes through the same manifest writer the page does, so a
 * change to the manifest shape reaches these suites instead of leaving them asserting a shape
 * nothing produces any more.
