 * at one route to 4 at thirteen, so it was a near-miss exactly where the tree actually sits. This

 * for every route past it — a route cannot breach it without costing more than any route measured.
 *
 * Flat below the swept length, which is the whole sweep's upper bound too: the count rises with the
 * prefix, so one number above its top row is above every row. The fence is only ever asked about
 * the real tree, and routes are only ever added.
 *
 * Two-sided in the test beside it. An envelope more than the margin above the build is a fence
 * nobody re-derived, and it fails there rather than surviving as headroom for a bump.
 *
 * The route count stays the only term. A deferred engine belongs inside one artifact and costs one
 * script: C7.10 item B first reached mermaid with `import('mermaid')`, which emitted 103 more
 * because mermaid lazily imports each of its own diagram types, and a second term admitting those
 * would have raised this fence far enough to admit any split at all. The build test's control is
 * what holds that line.
