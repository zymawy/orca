/**
 * The mobile-view frame budget, held against Chromium's own JPEG encoder across the viewport range.
 *
 * `WORST_CASE_JPEG_BYTES_PER_PIXEL` is the one number the budget cannot derive, and every other
 * check of it is circular: a case that encodes `noise(area * theConstant)` is measuring a byte
 * count the constant just produced, so it agrees with the constant whatever the constant says. This
 * encodes a real noise JPEG per viewport, at the scale the real budget picks, and posts it through
 * the real `BridgeHostSubscriptions`. It is the only thing here that can falsify the number.
 *
 * Chromium rather than a Node encoder, because the frames are CDP screencast frames: the bytes the
 * budget has to survive are the ones Chromium produces, not the ones another library would. And
 * `Page.startScreencast` rather than `canvas.toDataURL`, because that is the encoder the product
 * runs: the certification and the pane now go through one code path, so a drift in it cannot show
 * up in the product without showing up here.
 *
 * In `config/scripts` rather than the mobile suite for that reason — this is where a browser is
 * available — and it drives the mobile modules directly, so the budget, the scale and the host are
 * all the real ones.
 *
 * Named into the `mobile-web-app-` family so two things hold without anyone remembering them: the
 * `mobile_web_app` job's filter picks it up, and `pr-code-change-scope.mjs` fires that job when
 * this file changes. Both key off that prefix.
