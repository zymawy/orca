/**
 * What the session screen may reach for a URL, and whose clipboard it writes.
 *
 * Inside the shell's WebView react-native-web's `Linking.openURL` calls
 * `window.open(url, '_blank', 'noopener')`, which both shells refuse — iOS returns nil from
 * `createWebViewWith`, Android false from `onCreateWindow` — and resolves whether or not anything
 * opened. A call site left on that path reports success into a tap that did nothing, which is the
 * one failure the `externalLink` grant exists to remove.
 *
 * This screen's openers are a terminal link tap whose open mode is the phone's browser, and the two
 * WebView-backed readers it reaches through the file and Markdown panels, each of which sends a
 * tapped link to the system browser rather than navigating the artifact away.
 *
 * The rule, not the three call sites it happens to have today: a module entering this closure later
 * is held to it without anyone remembering to add it here.

 * The screen does not touch the clipboard through the browser's own.

 * secure context, and the iOS shell serves the page from a custom scheme while Android serves
 * `https`, so that path works on one platform and silently not on the other. This screen is the
 * heaviest clipboard user in the app — a quick command's body, a diff note, a Markdown document, a
 * terminal selection, a structured send prompt, and the terminal's own paste — so all of it goes
 * through the seam and none of it through the browser.
 *
 * Asserted as the module's absence from the closure rather than as a count of importers: a new
 * import anywhere in the tree puts the file back, whoever writes it and whatever they name it.
