 * `contenteditable` element in a string of markup, sized by a rule in a stylesheet the same module
 * emits, and the walk there matches JSX `TextInput` tags and `style` props. So the editor shipped
 * at 14 px and was measured at 14 px in both engines — the exact condition the floor exists for,
 * because iOS zooms the page on focus of any editable under 16 px, never zooms back, and
 * `keyboard-occlusion.web.ts` then answers 0 for the rest of the session at a scale other than 1.
 *
 * The rule is over the closure rather than over a list of known editors, for the same reason the
