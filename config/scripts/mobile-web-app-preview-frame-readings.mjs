 * `mobile-web-app-preview-csp-reports.mjs` were: the rig file holds how an arm is driven and what
 * each case claims, and this holds what a driven arm reports. They grow for different reasons -- a
 * case is added when a fence is added, a reading when a fence becomes measurable in a new way -- and
 * together they were over the 600-line cap the moment C8.1's link readings landed.
 *
 * Every reading is taken after the arm has settled, and every one that reaches inside the frame
 * falls back to null: the frame is an opaque origin, so an engine that refuses to evaluate in one
 * reports absence rather than failing the arm. A case that depends on such a reading therefore pins
 * a presence precondition beside it.
