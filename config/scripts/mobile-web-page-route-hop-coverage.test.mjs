/**
 * Every in-page hop between page routes, and whether the opener's grants cover the target.
 *
 * Grants are resolved once, from the route the shell opened, so a push kept inside the document
 * runs the target under the opener's list. C2.9 made the handoff refuse to keep a hop it cannot
 * cover, which is the fix; this is the census that says which hops those are, so adding a grant to
 * a route — or a new push between two — shows up as a change here rather than as a verb that
 * silently refuses on a device.
 *
 * Openers are every page route, not the one that pushes: on a wide layout `app/h/_layout.tsx`
 * renders the worktree-list sidebar beside every `/h` route, and its header pushes tasks. That is
 * what makes a pairwise pin the wrong shape — the sidebar reaches everything.
 *
 * Targets are the routes the app navigates to, read from its call sites rather than from every
 * `/h/...` template in the sources: a route's own mount declares its pathname, so harvesting those
 * made every declared route reachable and the filter inert.

 * that the running rule hands off -- and the other way round once an optional grant is the only

/**
 * Which hops the rule hands to the shell, pinned by name.
 *
 * Empty would mean every page route covers every other, which is not a property this codebase has
 * and not one to assume: the point of the pin is that a new entry appears when a route's grants
 * grow, and that the entry is read before it ships rather than found on a device.
 *
 * What is NOT here is the point of the census. `files/[worktreeId] -> files/preview/[worktreeId]`
 * is absent because the preview declares no more than the explorer, so that hop stays in the
 * document — which is C3.1's pairwise pin, now a consequence of the rule rather than a rule of its
 * own. Absent for the same reason, and measured rather than reasoned: the four hops the worktree
 * list and the history screen make into the explorer and its preview, which left this list when
 * those two declared the `externalLink` their own protocol wall reaches and took it from 23 rows
 * to 19. The four now declare the same four grants, so a tapped file costs no native frame and no
 * second bridge session.
 *
 * What remains beside the session rows is twelve: four openers holding no `native.clipboard.write`
 * into the three routes that ask for it — tasks, the hub and review.
 *
 * Absent for the same reason, and the reason C4 registered its two routes in one PR:
 * `source-control ⇄ review` in both directions. The hub's rows push review and review replaces
 * back, and the two declare the same five grants, so both hops stay in the document. Either one
 * landing alone would have put a handoff — a new native screen and a new bridge session — between
 * a changed-file row and its diff.
 *
 * The seven C7 rows are the same rule with the arrows all one way: every one `X -> session`, one
 * from each other page route. The session screen's thirteen grants are a strict
 * superset of every other route's, so nothing can reach it under the grants it was opened with —
 * and nothing it pushes to leaves, because its own seven targets each declare a subset. A row in
 * the other direction would mean a route had grown a grant the session lacks.
