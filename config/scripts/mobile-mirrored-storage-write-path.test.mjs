/**
 * One owner for the mirror the hybrid shell reads (ruling 35).
 *
 * `mirrored-storage-keys.ts` holds the map the shell builds every `init` from, synchronously, and
 * before this the fourteen writers of a mirrored key noted it themselves — first, then persisted.
 * On the page a persist can be refused, so twelve of them left the map holding a value no store
 * had taken and the next `init` handed the page exactly that; the other two undid it by hand.
 *
 * Source-scanning rather than behavioural, and about existence rather than shape: what a
 * behavioural case cannot say is that no thirteenth writer appears next week. Each row below is a
 * module that owns a mirrored key, so deleting its write path reds that row by name, and every
 * failure quotes the line it found.
