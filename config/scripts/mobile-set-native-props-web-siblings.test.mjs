/**
 * Every `setNativeProps` write the mobile app makes, and the web sibling it owes.
 *
 * `setNativeProps` is a React Native host-component method. On React Native Web a ref is the DOM
 * node itself and has no such method, so the call is not a write that does nothing — it is a
 * `TypeError`. Where it is made from a render or an effect, that throw reaches the page's fault
 * boundary and takes the whole screen down; the shell then tears the view out from under the
 * route, which is how one imperative write becomes a 0x0 terminal and a keyboard that never
 * opens.
 *
 * Fenced by absence rather than by a list of approved callers: a module that starts writing this
 * way is held to the rule without anyone remembering to add it here. The rule names the file
 * rather than the call, because a `.web.ts(x)` sibling is what the page bundler resolves in its
 * place, and that substitution is per module.
 *
 * Both trees the bundler resolves out of are scanned, and `app` is judged more strictly: a route
 * file may not make the call at all, because expo-router registers a `.web.tsx` beside a route as
 * a second route rather than as a platform sibling, so the split has to live in `src`.
 *
 * Two offences this caught, both invisible natively and both now fixed by one seam:
 * `use-terminal-live-pending-input-flush.ts` cleared the live-input field from the session route's
 * mount effect, and `use-terminal-live-accessory-input-commit.ts` wrote the shortened text into it
 * when the accessory bar erased a character. Both now call
 * `src/terminal/terminal-live-input-text-write.ts`, which ships the sibling.

 * all and the write has to move into a `src` module that can.
