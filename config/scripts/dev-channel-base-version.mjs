/**
 * The base `X.Y.Z` an hourly or adhoc build should carry.
 *
 * Why not package.json alone: main's version only moves on `release:` commits, and
 * stable patches are cut from release branches that never merge back. On
 * 2026-08-03 main read `1.4.165-rc.0` for twenty hours while 1.4.165, 1.4.166 and
 * 1.4.167 all shipped — so hourlies built from that main claimed 1.4.165 while
 * carrying code newer than 1.4.167, and sorted *below* the stable their user was
 * already running. Git tags (not GitHub releases) are the honest answer to "what
 * number is taken": unpublishing a buggy cut deletes the GitHub release and
 * leaves the tag, which still owns that number. Channel tags (`1.4.203-hourly.*`)
 * are a second floor so that unpublish cannot drag the series backwards.
 * package.json is a floor, not a source of truth.
