/**
 * What a page route's own closure asks the shell for, read from the call sites rather than listed.
 *
 * Grants are resolved once, from the route the shell opened, and carried for the life of the
 * session: a route that reaches a seam it did not declare is a page whose action is refused at the
 * host with nothing on screen to say why. Ruling 33.3 wrote that rule once and drove it over every
 * row rather than leaving a grant pinned by the list it was copied from. Six rows pin eight of the
 * session route's thirteen grants here; the other five have censuses of their own, as does the
 * optional grant declared beside them.
 *
 * Parsed, not matched. A regex over source text finds the seam named in a comment, in a string and
 * in an import it does not call, and the first two are exactly what a census must not count.

 * `mobile-web-app-session-dictation-capture.test.mjs` and `externalNavigation` has
 * `mobile-web-app-external-navigation-grant.test.mjs`, so those six are not repeated here. The
 * media three share one seam and one row: `useMediaPicker` is the only way in, and `canPickMedia`
 * is `pick && read && release`, so a route reaching it needs all three or none of them.
 *
 * `externalNavigation` could not be a row here whatever it owned, and that is the rule rather than a
 * detail: a row is a call site the walk can find, and the shell's cancelled-navigation behaviour has
 * none. Nothing is requested and nothing is answered, so the only thing a closure holds is a read of
 * `init.grants.native` -- which is what its own census walks for.
