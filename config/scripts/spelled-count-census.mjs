/**
 * Counts a comment spells out, read back and compared with the table each is a count of.
 *
 * Prose is where a count drifts. #22072 removed one grant from the session route and left
 * "Fourteen grants" and "the four audio verbs" standing in five files, none of which a reader can
 * tell from a fact. Naming the table in the sentence does not help either: the number is still a
 * copy, and a copy is what goes stale.
 *
 * A row names the words a number precedes. Every number word found before them anywhere in the
 * file has to be the one the table counts, so a second spelling left behind fails too rather than
 * passing on the first correct hit, and a phrase rewrapped at a different column still matches.
 * Repeats of the right word collapse, because a claim restated is still one claim; a phrase with no
 * number before it anywhere reads as the empty list, which no table count matches.
