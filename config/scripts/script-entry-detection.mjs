 * Whether this module was run as the entry script. Two ways to get this wrong, both of which end
 * with a builder exiting 0 having written nothing: `file://${path}` never matches on Windows,
 * where import.meta.url is `file:///C:/...`; and Node resolves symlinks in import.meta.url but not
 * in argv[1], so `node /tmp/...` against a /private/tmp realpath compares two different strings.
 * Both seams are injectable so win32 and a missing path can be exercised from a posix runner.
