/**
 * Nothing the tasks page reaches opens a URL through react-native, or a clipboard through the
 * browser's.
 *
 * Inside the shell's WebView react-native-web's `Linking.openURL` calls
 * `window.open(url, '_blank')`, which both shells refuse — iOS returns nil from
 * `createWebViewWith`, Android false from `onCreateWindow` — and resolves whether or not anything
 * opened. So a call site left on that path reports success into a tap that did nothing, which is
 * the one failure the `externalLink` grant exists to remove.
 *
 * The rule, not the twelve call sites it happens to have today: a module entering this closure
 * later is held to it without anyone remembering to add it here.
