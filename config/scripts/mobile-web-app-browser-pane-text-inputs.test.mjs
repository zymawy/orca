/**
 * The browser pane's two text inputs, read the way C4.2's census reads them.
 *
 * The pane is not in any page route today, so no route closure reaches it and the census that
 * enforces the seam is not run against it: it walks the source-control hub and the review route,
 * and the pane is in neither. C6 raises both inputs anyway, because the failure is not cosmetic —
 * an input under 16px makes an iOS browser zoom the page on focus, and `keyboard-occlusion.web.ts`
 * reads a visual viewport scale other than 1 as "no keyboard" for the rest of the typing session.
 *
 * This file is the census run by hand over the pane's own modules, so the raise is checked by the
 * rule that will judge it once a route lists the pane.
