; electron-builder NSIS hooks for the Orca Windows installer.
;
; electron-builder accepts exactly ONE `nsis.include` file, so every customInstall /
; customUnInstall hook Orca needs lives here.

; Markdown "Open with Orca" (issue #10138)
;
; Why hand-rolled instead of electron-builder's `fileAssociations` on Windows:
; app-builder-lib emits !insertmacro APP_ASSOCIATE, whose first line is
;   WriteRegStr SHELL_CONTEXT "Software\Classes\.md" "" "<ProgID>"
; That overwrites whichever editor currently owns .md, with no backup, for every
; existing user on their next UPDATE - and APP_UNASSOCIATE never restores it, so
; uninstalling Orca would leave .md pointing at a deleted ProgID.
;
; These writes are additive only. Registering a ProgID plus an OpenWithProgids
; hint and an Applications\<exe>\SupportedTypes entry puts Orca in Explorer's
; "Open with" list and in "Choose another app", while the default handler stays
; exactly where the user left it. Never add a `Software\Classes\.<ext>` default
; value here.
;
; MARKDOWN_PROGID must stay in sync with the extension list handled by
; isMarkdownDocumentName() in src/main/ipc/markdown-documents.ts.

; Clean up the relocated terminal daemon on a REAL uninstall.
;
; Why: the daemon host is deliberately copied OUT of the install dir into
; %LOCALAPPDATA%\Orca\daemon-host so that app UPDATES cannot kill it —
; electron-builder's kill sweep selects processes whose image path is under
; $INSTDIR, and that relocation is what keeps terminals alive across updates.
; The same design means a normal uninstall's process sweep and file removal both
; miss it, leaving an orphaned daemon plus its runtime copy behind.
;
; The ${isUpdated} guard is essential: electron-builder runs this uninstaller as
; part of uninstallOldVersion on EVERY update, and killing the daemon there would
; defeat the whole feature. Only clean up on a genuine uninstall.
;
; The LOCALAPPDATA folder name must stay in sync with LOCAL_HOST_ROOT_NAME in
; src/main/daemon/daemon-host-relocation.ts. See
; docs/reference/windows-daemon-host-relocation.md.
